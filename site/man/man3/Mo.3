Mo \- Micro Objects. Mo is less.

use Mo. Mo is less. Much less.
.PP
Moose is huge. Moose led to Mouse led to Moo led to Mo. M is nothing. Mo is
more. Not much.
.PP
When Moo is more than you need, drop an 'o' and get some Mo.
.PP
To get just a little Mo from Mo, use \*(L"Mo Features\*(R" below.
.SH "Core Features"
.IX Header "Core Features"
This is what you get. Nothing Mo.
.ie n .IP """new"" method" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWnew\fR method" 4
.IX Item "new method"
Mo provides a \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR object constructor. You pass it a list of name/value
pairs and it returns a new object.
.Sp
Constructor will not call \s-1BUILD\s0 methods. This is available using the
Mo::build feature.
.ie n .IP """extends""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWextends\fR" 4
.IX Item "extends"
Mo exports the \f(CW\*(C`extends\*(C'\fR keyword, to declare your parent class. \f(CW\*(C`Mo::Object\*(C'\fR
itself is your default parent class.
.Sp
Mo only supports single inheritance. If you need multiple inheritance or
roles, you should upgrade to Moo.
.ie n .IP """has""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhas\fR" 4
.IX Item "has"
Mo exports a \f(CW\*(C`has\*(C'\fR keyword, to generate accessors.
.Sp
These accessors always support both \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`set\*(C'\fR operations. That's it.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    has name => ();
\&    has thing => (foo => \*(Aqbar\*(Aq);  # arguments silently ignored
.Ve
.Sp
All arguments passed to \f(CW\*(C`has\*(C'\fR are ignored. This makes it easier to switch
between Mo and Moo, without having to change all your accessors.
.ie n .IP """strict"" and ""warnings""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWstrict\fR and \f(CWwarnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "strict and warnings"
Mo turns on \f(CW\*(C`use strict\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`use warnings\*(C'\fR for you.
.IP "Embeddable" 4
.IX Item "Embeddable"
Mo is tiny. It is compressed into a single line. You can easily inline it in
your code, should you want to do that. See Mo::Inline for more information,
including a utility that will do it for you.
.SH "Mo Features"
.IX Header "Mo Features"
Mo is the bare minimum needed for Perl \s-1OO.\s0 Many times you'll want just a
couple more features. Don't worry. Mo's got you covered:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    use Mo qw\*(Aqbuild default builder coerce is required\*(Aq;
\&    has name1 => ( default => sub { \*(AqJoe\*(Aq } );
\&    has name2 => ( builder => \*(Aqname_builder\*(Aq );
\&    has name3 => ( coerce => sub {$_[0]} );
\&    has name4 => ( is => \*(Aqro\*(Aq );
\&    has name4 => ( required => 1 );
\&    sub BUILD {
\&        my $self = shift;
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Mo simply loads the feature classes Mo::build, Mo::default,
Mo::builder, Mo::coerce, Mo::is and Mo::required. 
The first one supports \s-1BUILD\s0 constructing and the other three
add their magics to \f(CW\*(C`has\*(C'\fR. A Mo::Feature module can enhance \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`extends\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`has\*(C'\fR, and also add new export subs, or remove existing ones.
Features can also be combined for a single accessor.
See Mo::Features for a list of all the features and for an explanation of
the Feature \s-1API..\s0
