.SS "\s-1DESCRIPTION\s0"
.IX Subsection "DESCRIPTION"
perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl in an
easy way. It provides multiple isolated perl environments, and a mechanism
for you to switch between them.
.PP
Everything are installed unter \f(CW\*(C`~/perl5/perlbrew\*(C'\fR. You then need to include a
bashrc/cshrc provided by perlbrew to tweak the \s-1PATH\s0 for you. You then can
benefit from not having to run \f(CW\*(C`sudo\*(C'\fR commands to install
cpan modules because those are installed inside your \f(CW\*(C`HOME\*(C'\fR too.
.PP
For the documentation of perlbrew usage see perlbrew command
on MetaCPAN <https://metacpan.org/>, or by running \f(CW\*(C`perlbrew help\*(C'\fR,
or by visiting perlbrew's official website <https://perlbrew.pl/>. The following documentation
features the \s-1API\s0 of \f(CW\*(C`App::perlbrew\*(C'\fR module, and may not be remotely
close to what your want to read.
.SS "\s-1INSTALLATION\s0"
.IX Subsection "INSTALLATION"
It is the simplest to use the perlbrew installer, just paste this statement to
your terminal:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    curl \-L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
.Ve
.PP
Or this one, if you have \f(CW\*(C`fetch\*(C'\fR (default on FreeBSD):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    fetch \-o\- https://install.perlbrew.pl | sh
.Ve
.PP
After that, \f(CW\*(C`perlbrew\*(C'\fR installs itself to \f(CW\*(C`~/perl5/perlbrew/bin\*(C'\fR, and you
should follow the instruction on screen to modify your shell rc file to put it
in your \s-1PATH.\s0
.PP
The installed perlbrew command is a standalone executable that can be run with
system perl. The minimum system perl version requirement is 5.8.0, which should
be good enough for most of the OSes these days.
.PP
A fat-packed version of patchperl is also installed to
\&\f(CW\*(C`~/perl5/perlbrew/bin\*(C'\fR, which is required to build old perls.
.PP
The directory \f(CW\*(C`~/perl5/perlbrew\*(C'\fR will contain all install perl executables,
libraries, documentations, lib, site_libs. In the documentation, that directory
is referred as \f(CW\*(C`perlbrew root\*(C'\fR. If you need to set it to somewhere else because,
say, your \f(CW\*(C`HOME\*(C'\fR has limited quota, you can do that by setting \f(CW\*(C`PERLBREW_ROOT\*(C'\fR
environment variable before running the installer:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
\&    curl \-L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
.Ve
.PP
As a result, different users on the same machine can all share the same perlbrew
root directory (although only original user that made the installation would
have the permission to perform perl installations.)
.PP
You may also install perlbrew from \s-1CPAN:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    cpan App::perlbrew
.Ve
.PP
In this case, the perlbrew command is installed as \f(CW\*(C`/usr/bin/perlbrew\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/local/bin/perlbrew\*(C'\fR or others, depending on the location of your system
perl installation.
.PP
Please make sure not to run this with one of the perls brewed with
perlbrew. It's the best to turn perlbrew off before you run that, if you're
upgrading.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    perlbrew off
\&    cpan App::perlbrew
.Ve
.PP
You should always use system cpan (like /usr/bin/cpan) to install
\&\f(CW\*(C`App::perlbrew\*(C'\fR because it will be installed under a system \s-1PATH\s0 like
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/bin\*(C'\fR, which is not affected by perlbrew \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`use\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`self\-upgrade\*(C'\fR command will not upgrade the perlbrew installed by cpan
command, but it is also easy to upgrade perlbrew by running \f(CW\*(C`cpan App::perlbrew\*(C'\fR
again.
.SS "\s-1METHODS\s0"
.IX Subsection "METHODS"
.IP "(Str) current_perl" 4
.IX Item "(Str) current_perl"
Return the \*(L"current perl\*(R" object attribute string, or, if absent, the value of
\&\f(CW\*(C`PERLBREW_PERL\*(C'\fR environment variable.
.IP "(Str) current_perl (Str)" 4
.IX Item "(Str) current_perl (Str)"
Set the \f(CW\*(C`current_perl\*(C'\fR object attribute to the given value.
.SS "\s-1PROJECT DEVELOPMENT\s0"
.IX Subsection "PROJECT DEVELOPMENT"
perlbrew project <https://perlbrew.pl/> uses github
<https://github.com/gugod/App\-perlbrew/issues> and \s-1RT\s0
<https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=App\-perlbrew> for issue
tracking. Issues sent to these two systems will eventually be reviewed
and handled.
