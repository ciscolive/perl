.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This plugin allows you to define any executable as a transformer.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
This plugin accepts the following configuration options:
.SS "cmd"
.IX Subsection "cmd"
This is the command to be run. This is required.
.SS "argv"
.IX Subsection "argv"
This is a string containing additional arguments to be passed to the command.
These arguments will always be passed.
.SS "file_flag"
.IX Subsection "file_flag"
This is the flag used to tell the command what file to operate on, if it has
one.
.PP
By default, the file is simply passed as the last argument. However, many
commands will want this passed with a flag like \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-file\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-input\*(C'\fR.
.SS "ok_exit_codes"
.IX Subsection "ok_exit_codes"
By default, any exit code other than \f(CW0\fR is considered an exception. However,
many commands use their exit code to indicate that there was a validation issue
as opposed to an exception.
.PP
You can specify multiple exit codes either by listing \f(CW\*(C`ok_exit_codes\*(C'\fR multiple
times or as a space-separate list.
.SH "SUPPORT"
.IX Header "SUPPORT"

.PP
I am also usually active on \s-1IRC\s0 as 'autarch' on \f(CW\*(C`irc://irc.perl.org\*(C'\fR.
