This module is a placeholder in the Graph-ReadWrite distribution,
which is a collection of modules for reading and writing directed graphs.
.PP
You don't use \f(CW\*(C`Graph::ReadWrite\*(C'\fR, you use one of the reader or writer
modules for a specific format:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Reader::Dot \-
class for reading a Graph instance from Dot format.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Reader::HTK \- read an \s-1HTK\s0 lattice in as an instance of Graph.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Reader::XML \- class for reading a Graph instance from \s-1XML\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Writer::Dot \- write out directed graph in Dot format
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Writer::HTK \- write a perl Graph out as an \s-1HTK\s0 lattice file
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Writer::VCG \- write out directed graph in \s-1VCG\s0 format
.IP "\(bu" 4
Graph::Writer::XML \- write out directed graph as \s-1XML\s0
.IP "\(bu" 4
