.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module helps run test scripts in IDEs like Komodo.
.PP
When running test scripts in an \s-1IDE\s0 i have to set up a project file defining the
dist dir to run tests in and a lib dir to load additional modules from. Often I
didn't feel like doing that, especially when i only wanted to do a small patch
to a dist. In those cases i added a \s-1BEGIN\s0 block to mangle the environment for
me.
.PP
This module basically is that \s-1BEGIN\s0 block. It automatically moves up one
directory when it cannot see the test script in \*(L"t/$scriptname\*(R" and includes
\&'lib' in \f(CW@INC\fR when there's no blib present. That way the test ends up with
almost the same environment it'd get from EUMM/prove/etc., even when it's
actually run inside the t/ directory.
.PP
At the same time it will still function correctly when called by
EUMM/prove/etc., since it does not change the environment in those cases.
