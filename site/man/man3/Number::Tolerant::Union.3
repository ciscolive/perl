.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Number::Tolerant::Union is used by Number::Tolerant to represent the union
of multiple tolerances.  A subset of the same operators that function on a
tolerance will function on a union of tolerances, as listed below.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "new"
.IX Subsection "new"
.Vb 1
\&  my $union = Number::Tolerant::Union\->new(@list_of_tolerances);
.Ve
.PP
There is a \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR method on the Number::Tolerant::Union class, but unions are
meant to be created with the \f(CW\*(C`|\*(C'\fR operator on a Number::Tolerant tolerance.
.PP
The arguments to \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR are a list of numbers or tolerances to be unioned.
.PP
Intersecting ranges are not converted into a single range, but this may change
in the future.  (For example, the union of \*(L"5 to 10\*(R" and \*(L"7 to 12\*(R" is not \*(L"5 to
12.\*(R")
.SS "options"
.IX Subsection "options"
This method will return a list of all the acceptable options for the union.
.SS "Overloading"
.IX Subsection "Overloading"
Tolerance unions overload a few operations, mostly comparisons.
.IP "numification" 4
.IX Item "numification"
Unions numify to undef.  If there's a better idea, I'd love to hear it.
.IP "stringification" 4
.IX Item "stringification"
A tolerance stringifies to a short description of itself.  This is a set of the
union's options, parentheses-enclosed and joined by the word \*(L"or\*(R"
.IP "equality" 4
.IX Item "equality"
A number is equal to a union if it is equal to any of its options.
.IP "comparison" 4
.IX Item "comparison"
A number is greater than a union if it is greater than all its options.
.Sp
A number is less than a union if it is less than all its options.
.IP "union intersection" 4
.IX Item "union intersection"
An intersection (\f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR) with a union is commutted across all options.  In other
words:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& (a | b | c) & d  ==yields==> ((a & d) | (b & d) | (c & d))
.Ve
.Sp
Options that have no intersection with the new element are dropped.  The
intersection of a constant number and a union yields that number, if the number
was in the union's ranges and otherwise yields nothing.
.SH "TODO"
.IX Header "TODO"
Who knows.  Collapsing overlapping options, probably.
