.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBList::SomeUtils\fR provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
lists which is not going to go into List::Util.
.PP
All of the below functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl
code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module
couldn't be compiled on this machine.
.SH "WHY DOES THIS MODULE EXIST?"
.IX Header "WHY DOES THIS MODULE EXIST?"
You might wonder why this module exists when we already have
List::MoreUtils. In fact, this module is (nearly) the same code as is found
in \s-1LMU\s0 with no significant changes. However, the \s-1LMU\s0 distribution depends on
several modules for configuration (to run the Makefile.PL) that some folks in
the Perl community don't think are appropriate for a module high upstream in
the \s-1CPAN\s0 river.
.PP
I (Dave Rolsky) don't have a strong opinion on this, but I \fIdo\fR like the
functions provided by \s-1LMU,\s0 and I'm tired of getting patches and PRs to remove
\&\s-1LMU\s0 from my code.
.PP
This distribution exists to let me use the functionality I like without having
to get into tiring arguments about issues I don't really care about.
.SH "EXPORTS"
.IX Header "EXPORTS"
.SS "Default behavior"
.IX Subsection "Default behavior"
Nothing by default. To import all of this module's symbols use the \f(CW\*(C`:all\*(C'\fR tag.
Otherwise functions can be imported by name as usual:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use List::SomeUtils \*(Aq:all\*(Aq;
\&
\&    use List::SomeUtils qw{ any firstidx };
.Ve
.PP
Because historical changes to the \s-1API\s0 might make upgrading List::SomeUtils
difficult for some projects, the legacy \s-1API\s0 is available via special import
tags.

.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.SS "Junctions"
.IX Subsection "Junctions"
\fI\fITreatment of an empty list\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Treatment of an empty list"
.PP
There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an
empty list:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Reduction to an identity (boolean)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Result is undefined (three-valued)
.PP
In the first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is
determined by a mathematical reduction to an identity depending on whether
the underlying comparison is \*(L"or\*(R" or \*(L"and\*(R".  Conceptually:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&                    "any are true"      "all are true"
\&                    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-      \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&    2 elements:     A || B || 0         A && B && 1
\&    1 element:      A || 0              A && 1
\&    0 elements:     0                   1
.Ve
.PP
In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction
applied to an empty list returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR rather than true or false
.PP
Junctions with a \f(CW\*(C`_u\*(C'\fR suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those
without are boolean.
.PP
\fIall \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "all BLOCK LIST"
.PP
\fIall_u \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "all_u BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Returns a true value if all items in \s-1LIST\s0 meet the criterion given through
\&\s-1BLOCK.\s0 Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  print "All values are non\-negative"
\&    if all { $_ >= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);
.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST,\s0 \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition)
and \f(CW\*(C`all_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus, \f(CW\*(C`all_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? all(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: because Perl treats \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as false, you must check the return value
of \f(CW\*(C`all_u\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`defined\*(C'\fR or you will get the opposite result of what you
expect.

.PP
.Vb 2

\&    if any { $_ >= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);
.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST,\s0 \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR returns false and \f(CW\*(C`any_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus, \f(CW\*(C`any_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? any(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.

Logically the negation of \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR. Returns a true value if no item in \s-1LIST\s0 meets
the criterion given through \s-1BLOCK.\s0 Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  print "No non\-negative values"
\&    if none { $_ >= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);
.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST,\s0 \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR returns true (i.e. no values failed the condition)
and \f(CW\*(C`none_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus, \f(CW\*(C`none_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? none(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\fBNote\fR: because Perl treats \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR as false, you must check the return value

.PP
Logically the negation of \f(CW\*(C`all\*(C'\fR. Returns a true value if not all items in \s-1LIST\s0
meet the criterion given through \s-1BLOCK.\s0 Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in
turn:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  print "Not all values are non\-negative"
\&    if notall { $_ >= 0 } ($x, $y, $z);
.Ve
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST,\s0 \f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR returns false and \f(CW\*(C`notall_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.

Thus, \f(CW\*(C`notall_u(@list)\*(C'\fR is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`@list ? notall(@list) : undef\*(C'\fR.

Returns a true value if precisely one item in \s-1LIST\s0 meets the criterion

.PP
.Vb 2
\&    print "Precisely one value defined"
\&        if one { defined($_) } @list;
.Ve
.PP
Returns false otherwise.
.PP
For an empty \s-1LIST,\s0 \f(CW\*(C`one\*(C'\fR returns false and \f(CW\*(C`one_u\*(C'\fR returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The expression \f(CW\*(C`one BLOCK LIST\*(C'\fR is almost equivalent to
\&\f(CW\*(C`1 == true BLOCK LIST\*(C'\fR, except for short-cutting.
Evaluation of \s-1BLOCK\s0 will immediately stop at the second true value.
.SS "Transformation"

\fIapply \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR

.PP
Makes a copy of the list and then passes each element \fIfrom the copy\fR to the
\&\s-1BLOCK.\s0 Any changes or assignments to \f(CW$_\fR in the \s-1BLOCK\s0 will only affect the
elements of the new list. However, if \f(CW$_\fR is a reference then changes to the
referenced value will be seen in both the original and new list.
.PP
This function is similar to \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR but will not modify the elements of the
input list:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  my @list = (1 .. 4);
\&  my @mult = apply { $_ *= 2 } @list;

.Ve
.PP
Think of it as syntactic sugar for
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  for (my @mult = @list) { $_ *= 2 }
.Ve
.PP
Note that you must alter \f(CW$_\fR directly inside \s-1BLOCK\s0 in order for changes to
make effect. New value returned from the \s-1BLOCK\s0 are ignored:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  # @new is identical to @list.

.SS "Sorting"
.IX Subsection "Sorting"
\fIsort_by \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "sort_by BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Returns the list of values sorted according to the string values returned by the
\&\s-1KEYFUNC\s0 block or function. A typical use of this may be to sort objects according
to the string value of some accessor, such as
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort_by { $_\->name } @people
.Ve
.PP
The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as
both \f(CW$_\fR and the only argument in the parameters, \f(CW@_\fR. The values are then sorted
according to string comparisons on the values returned.
This is equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort { $a\->name cmp $b\->name } @people
.Ve
.PP
except that it guarantees the name accessor will be executed only once per value.
One interesting use-case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them
\&\*(L"naturally\*(R", rather than lexically.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort_by { s/(\ed+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings
.Ve
.PP
This sorts strings by generating sort keys which zero-pad the embedded numbers to
some level (9 digits in this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them
in the correct order.
.PP
\fInsort_by \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "nsort_by BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Similar to sort_by but compares its key values numerically.
.SS "Counting and calculation"
.IX Subsection "Counting and calculation"
\fItrue \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "true BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Counts the number of elements in \s-1LIST\s0 for which the criterion in \s-1BLOCK\s0 is true.
Sets \f(CW$_\fR for  each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  printf "%i item(s) are defined", true { defined($_) } @list;
.Ve
.PP
\fIfalse \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "false BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Counts the number of elements in \s-1LIST\s0 for which the criterion in \s-1BLOCK\s0 is false.
Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  printf "%i item(s) are not defined", false { defined($_) } @list;
.Ve
.PP
\fIminmax \s-1LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "minmax LIST"
.PP
Calculates the minimum and maximum of \s-1LIST\s0 and returns a two element list with
the first element being the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the
empty list if \s-1LIST\s0 was empty.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each
element is compared to two values being the so far calculated min and max value
in that it only requires 3n/2 \- 2 comparisons. Thus it is the most efficient
possible algorithm.
.PP
However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact
that there are more lines of Perl code involved. Therefore, \s-1LIST\s0 needs to be
fairly big in order for \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR to win over a naive implementation. This
limitation does not apply to the \s-1XS\s0 version.
.PP
\fImode \s-1LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "mode LIST"
.PP
Calculates the most common items in the list and returns them as a list. This
is effectively done by string comparisons, so references will be
stringified. If they implement string overloading, this will be used.
.PP
If more than one item appears the same number of times in the list, all such
items will be returned. For example, the mode of a unique list is the list
itself.
.PP
This function returns a list in list context. In scalar context it returns a
count indicating the number of modes in the list.
.SH "MAINTENANCE"
.IX Header "MAINTENANCE"
The maintenance goal is to preserve the documented semantics of the \s-1API\s0;
bug fixes that bring actual behavior in line with semantics are allowed.
New \s-1API\s0 functions may be added over time.  If a backwards incompatible
change is unavoidable, we will attempt to provide support for the legacy
\&\s-1API\s0 using the same export tag mechanism currently in place.
.PP
This module attempts to use few non-core dependencies. Non-core
configuration and testing modules will be bundled when reasonable;
run-time dependencies will be added only if they deliver substantial
benefit.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "KNOWN ISSUES"
There is a problem with a bug in 5.6.x perls. It is a syntax error to write
things like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } qw{ foo bar baz };
.Ve
.PP
It has to be written as either
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbaz\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @x = apply { s/foo/bar/ } my @dummy = qw/foo bar baz/;
.Ve
.PP
Perl 5.5.x and Perl 5.8.x don't suffer from this limitation.
.PP
If you have a functionality that you could imagine being in this module, please
drop me a line. This module's policy will be less strict than List::Util's
when it comes to additions as it isn't a core module.
.PP
When you report bugs, it would be nice if you could additionally give me the
output of your program with the environment variable \f(CW\*(C`LIST_MOREUTILS_PP\*(C'\fR set
to a true value. That way I know where to look for the problem (in \s-1XS,\s0
pure-Perl or possibly both).
