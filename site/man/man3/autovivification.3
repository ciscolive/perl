.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When an undefined variable is dereferenced, it gets silently upgraded to an array or hash reference (depending of the type of the dereferencing).
This behaviour is called \fIautovivification\fR and usually does what you mean (e.g. when you store a value) but it may be unnatural or surprising because your variables gets populated behind your back.
This is especially true when several levels of dereferencing are involved, in which case all levels are vivified up to the last, or when it happens in intuitively read-only constructs like \f(CW\*(C`exists\*(C'\fR.
.PP
This pragma lets you disable autovivification for some constructs and optionally throws a warning or an error when it would have happened.

Magically called when \f(CW\*(C`no autovivification @opts\*(C'\fR is encountered.
Enables the features given in \f(CW@opts\fR, which can be :
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqfetch\*(Aq\fR
.Sp
Turns off autovivification for rvalue dereferencing expressions, such as :
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    $value = $arrayref\->[$idx]
\&    $value = $hashref\->{$key}
\&    keys %$hashref
\&    values %$hashref
.Ve
.Sp
Starting from perl \f(CW5.11\fR, it also covers \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR on array references :
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    keys @$arrayref
\&    values @$arrayref
.Ve
.Sp
When the expression would have autovivified, \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned for a plain fetch, while \f(CW\*(C`keys\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`values\*(C'\fR return \f(CW0\fR in scalar context and the empty list in list context.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqexists\*(Aq\fR
.Sp
Turns off autovivification for dereferencing expressions that are parts of an \f(CW\*(C`exists\*(C'\fR, such as :
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    exists $arrayref\->[$idx]
\&    exists $hashref\->{$key}
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR is returned when the expression would have autovivified.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqdelete\*(Aq\fR
.Sp
Turns off autovivification for dereferencing expressions that are parts of a \f(CW\*(C`delete\*(C'\fR, such as :
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    delete $arrayref\->[$idx]
\&    delete $hashref\->{$key}
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned when the expression would have autovivified.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqstore\*(Aq\fR
.Sp
Turns off autovivification for lvalue dereferencing expressions, such as :
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    $arrayref\->[$idx] = $value
\&    $hashref\->{$key} = $value
\&    for ($arrayref\->[$idx]) { ... }
\&    for ($hashref\->{$key}) { ... }
\&    function($arrayref\->[$idx])
\&    function($hashref\->{$key})
.Ve
.Sp
An exception is thrown if vivification is needed to store the value, which means that effectively you can only assign to levels that are already defined.
In the example, this would require \f(CW$arrayref\fR (resp. \f(CW$hashref\fR) to already be an array (resp. hash) reference.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqwarn\*(Aq\fR
.Sp
Emits a warning when an autovivification is avoided for the categories specified in \f(CW@opts\fR.
.Sp
Note that \f(CW\*(C`no autovivification \*(Aqwarn\*(Aq\*(C'\fR currently does nothing by itself, in particular it does not make the default categories warn.
This behaviour may change in a future version of this pragma.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\fR
.Sp
Throws an exception when an autovivification is avoided for the categories specified in \f(CW@opts\fR.
.Sp
Note that \f(CW\*(C`no autovivification \*(Aqstrict\*(Aq\*(C'\fR currently does nothing by itself, in particular it does not make the default categories die.
This behaviour may change in a future version of this pragma.
.PP
Each call to \f(CW\*(C`unimport\*(C'\fR \fBadds\fR the specified features to the ones already in use in the current lexical scope.
.PP
When \f(CW@opts\fR is empty, it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`qw<fetch exists delete>\*(C'\fR.

Magically called when \f(CW\*(C`use autovivification @opts\*(C'\fR is encountered.
Disables the features given in \f(CW@opts\fR, which can be the same as for \*(L"unimport\*(R".
.PP
Each call to \f(CW\*(C`import\*(C'\fR \fBremoves\fR the specified features to the ones already in use in the current lexical scope.
.PP
When \f(CW@opts\fR is empty, it defaults to restoring the original Perl autovivification behaviour.
.SH "CONSTANTS"
.IX Header "CONSTANTS"
.ie n .SS """A_THREADSAFE"""
.el .SS "\f(CWA_THREADSAFE\fP"
.IX Subsection "A_THREADSAFE"
True if and only if the module could have been built with thread-safety features enabled.
This constant only has a meaning when your perl is threaded, otherwise it will always be false.
.ie n .SS """A_FORKSAFE"""
.el .SS "\f(CWA_FORKSAFE\fP"
.IX Subsection "A_FORKSAFE"
True if and only if this module could have been built with fork-safety features enabled.
This constant will always be true, except on Windows where it is false for perl 5.10.0 and below.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.IX Header "CAVEATS"
Using this pragma will cause a slight global slowdown of any subsequent compilation phase that happens anywere in your code \- even outside of the scope of use of \f(CW\*(C`no autovivification\*(C'\fR \- which may become noticeable if you rely heavily on numerous calls to \f(CW\*(C`eval STRING\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The pragma doesn't apply when one dereferences the returned value of an array or hash slice, as in \f(CW\*(C`@array[$id]\->{member}\*(C'\fR or \f(CW@hash{$key}\->{member}\fR.
This syntax is valid Perl, yet it is discouraged as the slice is here useless since the dereferencing enforces scalar context.
If warnings are turned on, Perl will complain about one-element slices.
.PP
Autovivifications that happen in code \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR'd during the global destruction phase of a spawned thread or pseudo-fork (the processes used internally for the \f(CW\*(C`fork\*(C'\fR emulation on Windows) are not reported.
