.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Are you sick of trying to remember whether a particular helper is defined in
List::Util, List::SomeUtils or List::UtilsBy? I sure am. Now you
don't have to remember. This module will export all of the functions that
either of those three modules defines.
.PP
Note that all function documentation has been shamelessly copied from
List::Util, List::SomeUtils and List::UtilsBy.
.SS "Which One Wins?"
.IX Subsection "Which One Wins?"
Recently, List::Util has started including some of the subs that used to
only be in List::SomeUtils. Similarly, List::SomeUtils has some small
overlap with List::UtilsBy. \f(CW\*(C`List::AllUtils\*(C'\fR always favors the subroutine
provided by List::Util, List::SomeUtils or List::UtilsBy in that
order.
.PP
The docs below come from List::Util 1.54, List::SomeUtils 0.58, and
List::UtilsBy 0.11.
.SH "WHAT IS EXPORTED?"
.IX Header "WHAT IS EXPORTED?"
All this module does is load List::Util, List::SomeUtils, and
List::UtilsBy, and then re-export everything that they provide. That means
that regardless of the documentation below, you will get any subroutine that
your installed version provides.
.SH "LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS"
.IX Header "LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS"
The following set of functions all apply a given block of code to a list of
values.
.SS "reduce"
.IX Subsection "reduce"
.Vb 1
\&    $result = reduce { BLOCK } @list
.Ve
.PP
Reduces \f(CW@list\fR by calling \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR in a scalar context multiple times,
setting \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR each time. The first call will be with \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR
set to the first two elements of the list, subsequent calls will be done by
setting \f(CW$a\fR to the result of the previous call and \f(CW$b\fR to the next element
in the list.
.PP
Returns the result of the last call to the \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR. If \f(CW@list\fR is empty then
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR is returned. If \f(CW@list\fR only contains one element then that element
is returned and \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR is not executed.
.PP
The following examples all demonstrate how \f(CW\*(C`reduce\*(C'\fR could be used to implement
the other list-reduction functions in this module. (They are not in fact
implemented like this, but instead in a more efficient manner in individual C
functions).
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $foo = reduce { defined($a)            ? $a :
\&                    $code\->(local $_ = $b) ? $b :
\&                                             undef } undef, @list # first
\&
\&    $foo = reduce { $a > $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # max
\&    $foo = reduce { $a gt $b ? $a : $b } \*(AqA\*(Aq..\*(AqZ\*(Aq   # maxstr
\&    $foo = reduce { $a < $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # min
\&    $foo = reduce { $a lt $b ? $a : $b } \*(Aqaa\*(Aq..\*(Aqzz\*(Aq # minstr
\&    $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 1 .. 10               # sum
\&    $foo = reduce { $a . $b } @bar                  # concat
\&
\&    $foo = reduce { $a || $code\->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar   # any
\&    $foo = reduce { $a && $code\->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar   # all
\&    $foo = reduce { $a && !$code\->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar  # none
\&    $foo = reduce { $a || !$code\->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar  # notall
\&       # Note that these implementations do not fully short\-circuit
.Ve
.PP
If your algorithm requires that \f(CW\*(C`reduce\*(C'\fR produce an identity value, then make
sure that you always pass that identity value as the first argument to prevent
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR being returned
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 0, @values;             # sum with 0 identity value
.Ve
.PP
The above example code blocks also suggest how to use \f(CW\*(C`reduce\*(C'\fR to build a
more efficient combined version of one of these basic functions and a \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR
block. For example, to find the total length of all the strings in a list,
we could use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $total = sum map { length } @strings;
.Ve
.PP
However, this produces a list of temporary integer values as long as the
original list of strings, only to reduce it down to a single value again. We
can compute the same result more efficiently by using \f(CW\*(C`reduce\*(C'\fR with a code
block that accumulates lengths by writing this instead as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $total = reduce { $a + length $b } 0, @strings
.Ve
.PP
The other scalar-returning list reduction functions are all specialisations of
this generic idea.
.SS "reductions"
.IX Subsection "reductions"
.Vb 1
\&    @results = reductions { BLOCK } @list
.Ve
.PP
\&\fISince version 1.54.\fR
.PP
Similar to \f(CW\*(C`reduce\*(C'\fR except that it also returns the intermediate values along
with the final result. As before, \f(CW$a\fR is set to the first element of the
given list, and the \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR is then called once for remaining item in the
list set into \f(CW$b\fR, with the result being captured for return as well as
becoming the new value for \f(CW$a\fR.
.PP
The returned list will begin with the initial value for \f(CW$a\fR, followed by
each return value from the block in order. The final value of the result will
be identical to what the \f(CW\*(C`reduce\*(C'\fR function would have returned given the same
block and list.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    reduce     { "$a\-$b" }  "a".."d"    # "a\-b\-c\-d"

.PP
\&\fISince version 1.33.\fR
.PP
Similar to \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR in that it evaluates \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR setting \f(CW$_\fR to each element
of \f(CW@list\fR in turn. \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR returns true if any element makes the \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR
return a true value. If \f(CW\*(C`BLOCK\*(C'\fR never returns true or \f(CW@list\fR was empty then
it returns false.
.PP
Many cases of using \f(CW\*(C`grep\*(C'\fR in a conditional can be written using \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR
instead, as it can short-circuit after the first true result.

true, and \f(CW\*(C`notall\*(C'\fR returns true only if not all of the values do.

=head1 \s-1KEY/VALUE PAIR LIST FUNCTIONS\s0
.PP
The following set of functions, all inspired by List::Pairwise, consume an
even-sized list of pairs. The pairs may be key/value associations from a hash,
or just a list of values. The functions will all preserve the original ordering
of the pairs, and will not be confused by multiple pairs having the same \*(L"key\*(R"
value \- nor even do they require that the first of each pair be a plain string.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR: At the time of writing, the following \f(CW\*(C`pair*\*(C'\fR functions that take a
block do not modify the value of \f(CW$_\fR within the block, and instead operate
using the \f(CW$a\fR and \f(CW$b\fR globals instead. This has turned out to be a poor
design, as it precludes the ability to provide a \f(CW\*(C`pairsort\*(C'\fR function. Better
would be to pass pair-like objects as 2\-element array references in \f(CW$_\fR, in
a style similar to the return value of the \f(CW\*(C`pairs\*(C'\fR function. At some future
version this behaviour may be added.
.PP
Until then, users are alerted \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR to rely on the value of \f(CW$_\fR remaining
unmodified between the outside and the inside of the control block. In
particular, the following example is \fB\s-1UNSAFE\s0\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& my @kvlist = ...
\&
\& foreach (qw( some keys here )) {
\&    my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $_ } @kvlist;
\&    ...
\& }
.Ve
.PP
Instead, write this using a lexical variable:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& foreach my $key (qw( some keys here )) {
\&    my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $key } @kvlist;
\&    ...
\& }
.Ve

.Vb 1
\&    my @pairs = pairs @kvlist;
.Ve
.PP
\&\fISince version 1.29.\fR
.PP
A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
returns a list of \f(CW\*(C`ARRAY\*(C'\fR references, each containing two items from the
given list. It is a more efficient version of
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @pairs = pairmap { [ $a, $b ] } @kvlist
.Ve
.PP
It is most convenient to use in a \f(CW\*(C`foreach\*(C'\fR loop, for example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
\&       my ( $key, $value ) = @$pair;
\&       ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Since version \f(CW1.39\fR these \f(CW\*(C`ARRAY\*(C'\fR references are blessed objects,
recognising the two methods \f(CW\*(C`key\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`value\*(C'\fR. The following code is
equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
\&       my $key   = $pair\->key;
\&       my $value = $pair\->value;
\&       ...
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
Since version \f(CW1.51\fR they also have a \f(CW\*(C`TO_JSON\*(C'\fR method to ease
serialisation.
.SS "unpairs"
.IX Subsection "unpairs"
.Vb 1
\&    my @kvlist = unpairs @pairs
.Ve
.PP
\&\fISince version 1.42.\fR
.PP
The inverse function to \f(CW\*(C`pairs\*(C'\fR; this function takes a list of \f(CW\*(C`ARRAY\*(C'\fR
references containing two elements each, and returns a flattened list of the
two values from each of the pairs, in order. This is notionally equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my @kvlist = map { @{$_}[0,1] } @pairs
.Ve
.PP
except that it is implemented more efficiently internally. Specifically, for
any input item it will extract exactly two values for the output list; using
\&\f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if the input array references are short.
.PP
Between \f(CW\*(C`pairs\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`unpairs\*(C'\fR, a higher-order list function can be used to
operate on the pairs as single scalars; such as the following near-equivalents
of the other \f(CW\*(C`pair*\*(C'\fR higher-order functions:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    @kvlist = unpairs grep { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
\&    # Like pairgrep, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
\&
\&    @kvlist = unpairs map { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
\&    # Like pairmap, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
.Ve
.PP
Note however that these versions will not behave as nicely in scalar context.
.PP
Finally, this technique can be used to implement a sort on a keyvalue pair
list; e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    @kvlist = unpairs sort { $a\->key cmp $b\->key } pairs @kvlist

There are two schools of thought for how to evaluate a junction on an
empty list:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Reduction to an identity (boolean)
.IP "\(bu" 4
Result is undefined (three-valued)
.PP
In the first case, the result of the junction applied to the empty list is
determined by a mathematical reduction to an identity depending on whether
the underlying comparison is \*(L"or\*(R" or \*(L"and\*(R".  Conceptually:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&                    "any are true"      "all are true"

\&    0 elements:     0                   1
.Ve
.PP
In the second case, three-value logic is desired, in which a junction
applied to an empty list returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR rather than true or false
.PP
Junctions with a \f(CW\*(C`_u\*(C'\fR suffix implement three-valued logic.  Those
without are boolean.

.SS "Sorting"
.IX Subsection "Sorting"
\fIsort_by \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "sort_by BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Returns the list of values sorted according to the string values returned by the
\&\s-1KEYFUNC\s0 block or function. A typical use of this may be to sort objects according
to the string value of some accessor, such as
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort_by { $_\->name } @people
.Ve
.PP
The key function is called in scalar context, being passed each value in turn as
both \f(CW$_\fR and the only argument in the parameters, \f(CW@_\fR. The values are then sorted
according to string comparisons on the values returned.
This is equivalent to
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort { $a\->name cmp $b\->name } @people
.Ve
.PP
except that it guarantees the name accessor will be executed only once per value.
One interesting use-case is to sort strings which may have numbers embedded in them
\&\*(L"naturally\*(R", rather than lexically.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  sort_by { s/(\ed+)/sprintf "%09d", $1/eg; $_ } @strings
.Ve
.PP
This sorts strings by generating sort keys which zero-pad the embedded numbers to
some level (9 digits in this case), helping to ensure the lexical sort puts them
in the correct order.

.PP
Counts the number of elements in \s-1LIST\s0 for which the criterion in \s-1BLOCK\s0 is true.
Sets \f(CW$_\fR for  each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  printf "%i item(s) are defined", true { defined($_) } @list;
.Ve
.PP
\fIfalse \s-1BLOCK LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "false BLOCK LIST"
.PP
Counts the number of elements in \s-1LIST\s0 for which the criterion in \s-1BLOCK\s0 is false.
Sets \f(CW$_\fR for each item in \s-1LIST\s0 in turn:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  printf "%i item(s) are not defined", false { defined($_) } @list;
.Ve
.PP
\fIminmax \s-1LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "minmax LIST"
.PP
Calculates the minimum and maximum of \s-1LIST\s0 and returns a two element list with
the first element being the minimum and the second the maximum. Returns the
empty list if \s-1LIST\s0 was empty.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR algorithm differs from a naive iteration over the list where each
element is compared to two values being the so far calculated min and max value
in that it only requires 3n/2 \- 2 comparisons. Thus it is the most efficient
possible algorithm.
.PP
However, the Perl implementation of it has some overhead simply due to the fact
that there are more lines of Perl code involved. Therefore, \s-1LIST\s0 needs to be
fairly big in order for \f(CW\*(C`minmax\*(C'\fR to win over a naive implementation. This
limitation does not apply to the \s-1XS\s0 version.
.PP
\fImode \s-1LIST\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "mode LIST"
.PP
Calculates the most common items in the list and returns them as a list. This
is effectively done by string comparisons, so references will be
stringified. If they implement string overloading, this will be used.
.PP
If more than one item appears the same number of times in the list, all such
items will be returned. For example, the mode of a unique list is the list
itself.
.PP
This function returns a list in list context. In scalar context it returns a
count indicating the number of modes in the list.

Removes elements from the referenced array on which the selection function

A hybrid between \*(L"extract_by\*(R" and \f(CW\*(C`List::Util::first\*(C'\fR. Removes the first

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a \*(L"donation\*(R" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.
.PP
Please note that \fBI am not suggesting that you must do this\fR in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.
.PP
Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).
.PP
To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at <https://www.urth.org/fs\-donation.html>.
