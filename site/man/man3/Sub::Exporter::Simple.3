.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
In your module:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    package Module;
\&
\&    use Sub::Exporter::Simple qw( function1 function2 function3 );
\&
\&    function1 { 1 }
\&    function2 { 2 }
\&    function3 { 3 }
.Ve
.PP
In your target:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Module qw( function1 );
\&
\&    function1();
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module is basically just a macro for:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    use Sub::Exporter \-setup => { exports => [ qw( function1 function2 function3 ) ] };
.Ve
.PP
I made it because i found myself in the situation of wanting to simply export some subs in a number of modules, but not
wanting to use Exporter, since Sub::Exporter offers a nicer \s-1API.\s0 However the default way of just exporting some
plain subs in Sub::Exporter is a bit cumbersome to type (especially repeatedly) and does not look very clean either.
(As far as typing effort goes, please do consider that [] and friends are often AltGr affairs in non-american layouts.)
So this module just acts as a macro for that functionality and reduces the amount of needed typing, while making things
look more clean.
.PP
That's all it does. It does not expose any other functionality of Sub::Exporter and never will. If you need more than
this, use the real thing.
