.SH "NAME"
List::SomeUtils::XS \- XS implementation for List::SomeUtils
.SH "VERSION"
.IX Header "VERSION"
version 0.58
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
There are no user-facing parts here. See List::SomeUtils for \s-1API\s0 details.
.PP
You shouldn't have to install this module directly. When you install
List::SomeUtils, it checks whether your system has a compiler. If it does,
then it adds a dependency on this module so that it gets installed and you
have the faster \s-1XS\s0 implementation.
.PP
This distribution requires List::SomeUtils but to avoid a circular
dependency, that dependency is explicitly left out from the this
distribution's metadata. However, without \s-1LSU\s0 already installed this module
cannot function.

.IX Header "DONATIONS"
If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a \*(L"donation\*(R" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.
.PP
Please note that \fBI am not suggesting that you must do this\fR in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.
.PP
Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).
.PP
To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
button at <http://www.urth.org/~autarch/fs\-donation.html>.
