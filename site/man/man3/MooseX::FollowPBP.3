.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes
the default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
separated into get and set methods. The get methods are prefixed with
\&\*(L"get_\*(R" as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with
\&\*(L"set_\*(R". This is the naming style recommended by Damian Conway in
\&\fIPerl Best Practices\fR.
.PP
If you define an attribute with a leading underscore, then both the
get and set method will also have an underscore prefix.
.PP
If you explicitly set a \*(L"reader\*(R" or \*(L"writer\*(R" name when creating an
attribute, then that attribute's naming scheme is left unchanged.
.SH "ACCESSORS IN ROLES"
.IX Header "ACCESSORS IN ROLES"
Prior to version 1.9900 of Moose, attributes added to a class ended up with
that class's attribute traits. That means that if your class used
\&\f(CW\*(C`MooseX::FollowPBP\*(C'\fR, any attributes provided by roles you consumed had the
semi-affordance style of accessor.
.PP
As of Moose 1.9900, that is no longer the case. Attributes provided by roles
no longer acquire the consuming class's attribute traits. However, with Moose
1.9900+, you can now use \f(CW\*(C`MooseX::FollowPBP\*(C'\fR directly in roles. Attributes
defined by that role will have semi-affordance style accessors, regardless of
what attribute traits the consuming class has.

automatically be notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.
