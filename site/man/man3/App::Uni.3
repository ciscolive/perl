This module installs a simple program, \fIuni\fR, that helps grepping through
the Unicode database included in the current Perl 5 installation.

.IX Header "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"
This is a re-implementation of a program written by Audrey Tang in Taiwan.  I
used that program for years before deciding I wanted to add a few features,
which I did by rewriting from scratch.
.PP
That program, in turn, was a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry
copied to me, which accompanied Audrey for years.  However, that program was
lost during a hard disk failure, so she coded it up from memory.
.PP
Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ♡
