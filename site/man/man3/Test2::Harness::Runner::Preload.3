.SH "NAME"
Test2::Harness::Runner::Preload \- DSL for building complex stage\-based preload
tools.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Test2::Harness allows you to preload libraries for a performance boost. This
module provides tools that let you go beyond that and build a more complex
preload. In addition you can build multiple preload \fIstages\fR, each stage will
be its own process and tests can run from a specific stage. This allows for
multiple different preload states from which to run tests.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.SS "\s-1USING YOUR PRELOAD\s0"
.IX Subsection "USING YOUR PRELOAD"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-P\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-preload\*(C'\fR options work for custom preload modules just as they
do regular modules. Yath will know the difference and act accordingly.

.PD
This export provides the meta object, which is an instance of this class. This
method being present is how Test2::Harness differentiates between a regular
module and a special preload library.
.IP "stage \s-1NAME\s0 => sub { ... }" 4
.IX Item "stage NAME => sub { ... }"
This creates a new stage with the given \f(CW\*(C`NAME\*(C'\fR, and then runs the coderef with
the new stage set as the \fIactive\fR one upon which the other function here will
operate. Once the coderef returns the \fIactive\fR stage is cleared.
.Sp
You may nest stages by calling this function again inside the codeblock.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE:\s0\fR stage names \fB\s-1ARE\s0\fR case sensitive. This can be confusing when you
consider that most harness directives are all-caps. In the following case the
stage requested by the test and the stage defined in
the library are \s-1NOT\s0 the same.
.Sp
In a test file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # HARNESS\-STAGE\-FOO
.Ve
.Sp
In a preload library:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    stage foo { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
Harness directives are all-caps, however the user data portion need not be,
this is fine:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # HARNESS\-STAGE\-foo
.Ve
.Sp
However it is very easy to make the mistake of thinking it is case insensitive.
It is also easy to assume the 'foo' part of the harness directive must be all
caps. In many cases it is smart to make your stage names all-caps.

This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called inside a \f(CW\*(C`stage()\*(C'\fR builder coderef.
.Sp
This adds modules to the list of libraries to preload. Order is preserved. You
can also add coderefs to execute arbitrary code between module loads.
.Sp
The coderef is called with no arguments, and its return is ignored.
.IP "\fBeager()\fR" 4
.IX Item "eager()"
This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called inside a \f(CW\*(C`stage()\*(C'\fR builder coderef.
.Sp
This marks the \fIactive\fR stage as being \fIeager\fR. An eager stage will start
running tests for nested stages if it finds itself with no tests of its own to
run before the nested stage can finish loading. The idea here is to avoid
unused test slots when possible allowing for tests to complete sooner.
.IP "\fBdefault()\fR" 4
.IX Item "default()"
This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called inside a \f(CW\*(C`stage()\*(C'\fR builder coderef.
.Sp
This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called only once across \f(CW\*(C`ALL\*(C'\fR stages in a given library.
.Sp
If multiple preload libraries are loaded then the \fIfirst\fR default set (based
on load order) will be the default, others will notbe honored.
.ie n .IP "$stage_name = file_stage($test_file)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$stage_name\fR = file_stage($test_file)" 4
.IX Item "$stage_name = file_stage($test_file)"
This is optional. If defined this callback will have a chance to look at all
files that are going to be run and assign them a stage. This may return undef
or an empty list if it does not have a stage to assign.
.Sp
If multiple preload libraries define file_stage callbacks they will be called
in order, the first one to return a stage name will win.
.Sp
If no file_stage callbacks provide a stage for a file then any harness
directives declaring a stage will be honored. If no stage is ever assigned then
the test will be run int he default stage.
.IP "pre_fork sub { ... }" 4
.IX Item "pre_fork sub { ... }"
This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called inside a \f(CW\*(C`stage()\*(C'\fR builder coderef.
.Sp
Add a callback to be run just before the preload-stage process forks to run the
test. Note that any state changes here can effect future tests to be run.
.IP "post_fork sub { ... }" 4
.IX Item "post_fork sub { ... }"
This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called inside a \f(CW\*(C`stage()\*(C'\fR builder coderef.
.Sp
Add a callback to be run just after the preload-stage process forks to run the
test. This is run as early as possible, things like \f(CW$0\fR may not be set
properly yet.
.IP "pre_launch sub { ... }" 4
.IX Item "pre_launch sub { ... }"
This \fB\s-1MUST\s0\fR be called inside a \f(CW\*(C`stage()\*(C'\fR builder coderef.
.Sp
Add a callback to be run just before control of the test process is turned over
to the test file itself. This is run as late as possible, so things like \f(CW$0\fR
should be set properly.
