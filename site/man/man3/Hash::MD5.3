.IX Header "MOTIVATION"
I need a package which I can grab the uniqueness of a Hashrefs in a md5 sum.
This I will compare to later processing.
My first approach was to use encode_json string.
Unfortunately, the resort was not very consistent.
.PP
So I wrote my first cpan packet in order also to learn.
