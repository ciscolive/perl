.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides a common client for constructing metabase facts and
the legacy email message sent to \s-1CPAN\s0 Testers in a way that is properly
parsed by the extraction and report tools. It is meant to be used by all
the \s-1CPAN\s0 clients (and standalone tools) that want/need to support the
\&\s-1CPAN\s0 Testers infrastructure.
.PP
If you need to parse or write to the common \s-1CPAN\s0 Testers configuration file,
please refer to the \fBhighly experimental\fR
CPAN::Testers::Common::Client::Config.
.SS "Constructor"
.IX Subsection "Constructor"
\fInew\fR
.IX Subsection "new"
.PP
Calling \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR creates a new object. You \fBmust\fR pass a hash as argument setting at least
\&\fIdistname\fR, \fIauthor\fR and \fIgrade\fR. See below for their meaning.
.SS "Accessors"
.IX Subsection "Accessors"
\fIauthor\fR
.IX Subsection "author"
.PP
\&\fBRequired\fR.
.PP
The evaluated distribution's author. Could be a \s-1PAUSE\s0 id or a full name.
.PP
\fIdistname\fR
.IX Subsection "distname"
.PP
\&\fBRequired\fR.
.PP
The distribution name, in \f(CW\*(C`Dist\-Name\-version.suffix\*(C'\fR format.
.PP
\fIgrade\fR
.IX Subsection "grade"
.PP
\&\fBRequired\fR.
.PP
The grade for the distribution's test result. Can be \f(CW\*(Aqpass\*(Aq\fR, \f(CW\*(Aqfail\*(Aq\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(Aqna\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\*(Aqunknown\*(Aq\fR.
.PP
\fIcomments\fR
.IX Subsection "comments"
.PP
Any additional comments from the tester. Defaults to \f(CW\*(Aqnone provided\*(Aq\fR
(but see \*(L"\s-1AUTOMATED_TESTING\*(R"\s0 below).
.PP
\fIvia\fR
.IX Subsection "via"
.PP
The sender module (CPAN::Reporter, \s-1CPANPLUS,\s0 etc). Defaults to
\&\*(L"Your friendly \s-1CPAN\s0 Testers client\*(R".
.PP
\fIcommand\fR
.IX Subsection "command"
.PP
The command used to test the distribution.
.SS "Methods"
.IX Subsection "Methods"
\fI\f(BIpopulate()\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "populate()"
.PP
Will populate the object with information for each Metabase fact, and create the \s-1CPAN\s0 Testers email body.
.PP
Returns a data structure containing all metabase facts data.
.PP
\fI\f(BIemail()\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "email()"
.PP
Returns a string to be used as body of the email to \s-1CPAN\s0 Testers.
.PP
This method \fBwill\fR call \f(CW\*(C`populate()\*(C'\fR if populate hasn't been called yet.
.PP
\fI\f(BImetabase_data()\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "metabase_data()"
.PP
Returns the already populated metabase data structure. Note that this will \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR call \f(CW\*(C`populate()\*(C'\fR
so you will get undef or cached data unless you call \f(CW\*(C`populate()\*(C'\fR yourself.
.PP
\fIis_duplicate\fR
.IX Subsection "is_duplicate"
.PP
Returns true if this report was already sent by the current user in the past,
and false otherwise.
.PP
\fIrecord_history\fR
.IX Subsection "record_history"
.PP
Records report into the history file (so \f(CW\*(C`is_duplicate()\*(C'\fR returns true for
it in the future.
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT"
.SS "\s-1AUTOMATED_TESTING\s0"
.IX Subsection "AUTOMATED_TESTING"
If the \f(CW\*(C`AUTOMATED_TESTING\*(C'\fR environment variable is set to true, the default comment will be:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   this report is from an automated smoke testing program
\&   and was not reviewed by a human for accuracy
.Ve
.PP
Otherwise, the default message is \f(CW\*(Aqnone provided\*(Aq\fR.

CPAN::Testers::Common::Client::Config also has
some interesting environment variables.
