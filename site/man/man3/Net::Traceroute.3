.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module implements a parser for various traceroute
implementations.  At present, it can parse most \s-1LBL\s0 traceroute
derivatives used on typical unixes, and the traceroute of cisco \s-1IOS.\s0
Traceroutes known not to be supported include that of Microsoft
Windows and HP-UX.
.PP
This module has two basic modes of operation, one, where it will run
traceroute for you, and the other where you provide text from
previously runing traceroute to parse.
.SH "OVERVIEW"
.IX Header "OVERVIEW"
A new Net::Traceroute object must be created with the \fInew\fR method.
Depending on exactly how the constructor is invoked, it may perform
some tracing and/or parsing actions immediately, or it may return a
\&\*(L"template\*(R" object that can be used to set parameters for several
subsequent traceroutes.
.PP
Methods are available for accessing information about a given
traceroute attempt.  There are also methods that view/modify the
options that are passed to the object's constructor.
.PP
To trace a route, \s-1UDP\s0 packets are sent with a small \s-1TTL\s0 (time-to-live)
field in an attempt to get intervening routers to generate \s-1ICMP
TIME_EXCEEDED\s0 messages.

.PP
This is the constructor for a new Net::Traceroute object.  If given
\&\f(CW\*(C`host\*(C'\fR, it will immediately perform the traceroute.  If given \f(CW\*(C`text\*(C'\fR,
it will parse that text as traceroute output.
.PP
Given an existing Net::Traceroute object \f(CW$obj\fR as a template, you can
call \f(CW$obj\fR\->\fBclone()\fR with the usual constructor parameters.  The same
rules apply about defining host; that is, traceroute will be run if it
is defined, or text will be parsed.  You can always pass
\&\f(CW\*(C`host =\*(C'\fR undef, text => undef> to clone.
.PP
Possible options are:
.PP
\&\fBhost\fR \- A host to traceroute to.  If you don't set this, you get a
Traceroute object with no traceroute data in it.  The module always
uses \s-1IP\s0 addresses internally and will attempt to lookup host names via
inet_aton.
.PP
\&\fBtext\fR \- Output from a previously run traceroute.  If set, and host
isn't, the given text will be parsed.
.PP
\&\fBbase_port\fR \- Base port number to use for the \s-1UDP\s0 queries.
Traceroute assumes that nothing is listening to port \f(CW\*(C`base_port\*(C'\fR to
\&\f(CW\*(C`base_port + (nhops \- 1)\*(C'\fR
where nhops is the number of hops required to reach the destination
address.  Default is what the system traceroute uses (normally 33434).
\&\f(CW\*(C`Traceroute\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
\&\fBdebuglvl\fR \- A number indicating how verbose debug information should
be.  Please include debug=>9 output in bug reports.
.PP
\&\fBmax_ttl\fR \- Maximum number of hops to try before giving up.  Default
is what the system traceroute uses (normally 30).  \f(CW\*(C`Traceroute\*(C'\fR's
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
\&\fBqueries\fR \- Number of times to send a query for a given hop.
Defaults to whatever the system traceroute uses (3 for most
traceroutes).  \f(CW\*(C`Traceroute\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-q\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
\&\fBquery_timeout\fR \- How many seconds to wait for a response to each
query sent.  Uses the system traceroute's default value of 5 if
unspecified.  \f(CW\*(C`Traceroute\*(C'\fR's \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
\&\fBtimeout\fR \- Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the traceroute to
complete.  If not specified, the traceroute will not return until the
host has been reached, or traceroute counts to infinity (\f(CW\*(C`max_ttl\*(C'\fR *
\&\f(CW\*(C`queries\*(C'\fR * \f(CW\*(C`query_timeout\*(C'\fR).  Note that this option is implemented
by Net::Traceroute, not the underlying traceroute command.
.PP
\&\fBsource_address\fR \- Select the source address that traceroute wil use.
.PP
\&\fBtos\fR \- Specify a ToS value for traceroute to use.
.PP
\&\fBpacketlen\fR \- Length of packets to use.  Traceroute tries to make the
\&\s-1IP\s0 packet exactly this long.
.PP
\&\fBtrace_program\fR \- Name of the traceroute program.  Defaults to traceroute.
You can pass traceroute6 to do IPv6 traceroutes.
.PP
\&\fBno_fragment\fR \- Set the \s-1IP\s0 don't fragment bit.  Some traceroute
programs will perform path mtu discovery with this option.
.PP
\&\fBuse_icmp\fR \- Request that traceroute perform probes with \s-1ICMP\s0 echo
packets, rather than \s-1UDP.\s0
.PP
\&\fBuse_tcp\fR \- Request that traceoute perform probes with \s-1TCP\s0 SYNs.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.IP "traceroute" 4
.IX Item "traceroute"
Run system traceroute, and parse the results.  Will fill in the rest
of the object for informational queries.
.IP "parse" 4
.IX Item "parse"
Parse the previously provided \f(CW\*(C`text\*(C'\fR, filling in the rest of the
object for queries.
.IP "argv" 4
.IX Item "argv"
Returns a list of arguments that traceroute will be invoked with.  For
debugging and/or overriding by subclasses.
.SS "Controlling traceroute invocation"
.IX Subsection "Controlling traceroute invocation"
Each of these methods return the current value of the option specified
by the corresponding constructor option.  They will set the object's
instance variable to the given value if one is provided.
.PP
Changing an instance variable will only affect newly performed
traceroutes.  Setting a different value on a traceroute object that
has already performed a trace has no effect.

aren't documented here.

Any of the methods in this section that return a count of something or
want an \fIN\fRth type count to identify something employ one based
counting.
.IP "stat" 4
.IX Item "stat"
Returns the status of a given traceroute object.  One of
\&\s-1TRACEROUTE_OK, TRACEROUTE_TIMEOUT,\s0 or \s-1TRACEROUTE_UNKNOWN\s0 (each defined
as an integer).  \s-1TRACEROUTE_OK\s0 will only be returned if the host was
actually reachable.

.IX Item "found"
Attempt to return 1 if the host was found, undef otherwise.  This test
is a poor heuristic, and will frequently give wrong answers.
.IP "pathmtu" 4
.IX Item "pathmtu"
If your traceroute supports \s-1MTU\s0 discovery, this method will return the

Returns the number of hops that it took to reach the host.
.IP "hop_queries(\s-1HOP\s0)" 4

.IX Item "hop_query_stat(HOP, QUERY)"
Return the status of the given \s-1HOP\s0's \s-1QUERY.\s0  The return status can be
one of the following (each of these is actually an integer constant
function defined in Net::Traceroute's export list):
.Sp

A source routed packet was rejected for some reason.  Shouldn't happen.

.SH "CLONING SUPPORT BEFORE 1.04"
.IX Header "CLONING SUPPORT BEFORE 1.04"
Net::Traceroute Versions before 1.04 used new to clone objects.  This
has been deprecated in favor of the \fBclone()\fR method.
.PP
If you have code of the form:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& my $template = Net::Traceroute\->new();
\& my $tr = $template\->new(host => "localhost");
.Ve
.PP
You need to change the \f(CW$template\fR\->new to \f(CW$template\fR\->clone.
.PP
This behavior was changed because it interfered with subclassing.
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
Net::Traceroute parses the output of the system traceroute command.
As such, it may not work on your system.  Support for more traceroute
outputs (e.g. Windows, \s-1HPUX\s0) could be done, although currently the
code assumes there is \*(L"One true traceroute\*(R".
.PP
The actual functionality of traceroute could also be implemented
natively in perl or linked in from a C library.
.PP
Versions prior to 1.04 had some interface issues for subclassing.
These issues have been addressed, but required a public interface
change.  If you were relying on the behavior of new to clone existing
objects, your code needs to be fixed.
