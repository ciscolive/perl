.SH "NAME"
Coro::EV \- do events the coro\-way, with EV
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\& use Coro;
\& use Coro::EV;

\& EV::READ & Coro::EV::timed_io_once $fh, EV::READ, 60
\&    or die "timeout\en";
\&
\& EV::run;

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module does two things: First, it offers some utility functions that
might be useful for threads (although Coro::AnyEvent offers more and
more portable functions), and secondly, it integrates Coro into the \s-1EV\s0
main loop:
.PP
Before the process blocks (in EV::run) to wait for events, this module
will schedule and run all ready (= runnable) threads of the same or
higher priority. After that, it will cede once to a threads of lower
priority, then continue in the event loop.
.PP
That means that threads with the same or higher priority as the threads
running the main loop will inhibit event processing, while threads of
lower priority will get the \s-1CPU,\s0 but cannot completeley inhibit event
processing. Note that for that to work you actually have to run the \s-1EV\s0
event loop in some thread.
.SH "RUNNING WITH OR WITHOUT A MAINLOOP"
.IX Header "RUNNING WITH OR WITHOUT A MAINLOOP"
In general, you should always run EV::run, either in your main program,
or in a separate coroutine. If you don't do that and all coroutines
start waiting for some events, this module will run the event loop once,
but this is very inefficient and will also not make it possible to run
background threads.
.PP
To run the \s-1EV\s0 event loop in a separate thread, you can simply do this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  async { EV::run };

.IX Header "FUNCTIONS"
.ie n .IP "$revents = Coro::EV::timed_io_once $fileno_or_fh, $events[, $timeout]" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$revents\fR = Coro::EV::timed_io_once \f(CW$fileno_or_fh\fR, \f(CW$events\fR[, \f(CW$timeout\fR]" 4
.IX Item "$revents = Coro::EV::timed_io_once $fileno_or_fh, $events[, $timeout]"
Blocks the coroutine until either the given event set has occurred on the
fd, or the timeout has been reached (if timeout is missing or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR
then there will be no timeout). Returns the received flags.
.Sp
Consider using \f(CW\*(C`Coro::AnyEvent::readable\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Coro::AnyEvent::writable\*(C'\fR
instead, they work with any AnyEvent-supported event loop.
.ie n .IP "Coro::EV::timer_once $after" 4
.el .IP "Coro::EV::timer_once \f(CW$after\fR" 4
.IX Item "Coro::EV::timer_once $after"
Blocks the coroutine for at least \f(CW$after\fR seconds.
.Sp
Consider using \f(CW\*(C`Coro::AnyEvent::sleep\*(C'\fR instead, which works with any
AnyEvent-supported event loop.
