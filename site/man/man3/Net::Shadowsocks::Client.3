\&    The new constructor lets you create a new Net::Shadowsocks::Client object or dies on error.
\&
\&    Example use:
\&
\&    my $foo = Net::Shadowsocks::Client\->new(
\&    local_address => \*(Aqlocalhost\*(Aq,
\&    local_port => 1491,
\&    password => \*(Aq49923641\*(Aq,
\&    server => \*(Aqjp.ssip.club\*(Aq,
\&    server_port => 23333,
\&    method => \*(Aqspritz\*(Aq,
\&    );
\&
\&    This is all you need to do. Take a look at client.pl under eg directory for a compelete example on how to
\&    use the client module.
