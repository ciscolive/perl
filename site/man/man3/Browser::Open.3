.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The functions optionaly exported by this module allows you to open URLs
in the user browser.
.PP
A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the
first one found is executed. With an optional parameter, all known
commands are checked.
.PP
The \*(L"open_browser\*(R" uses the \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR function to execute the
command. If you want more control, you can get the command with the
\&\*(L"open_browser_cmd\*(R" or \*(L"open_browser_cmd_all\*(R" functions and then
use whatever method you want to execute it.
.SH "API"

.PP
Find an appropriate command and executes it with your \f(CW$url\fR. If
\&\f(CW$all\fR is false, the default, only commands that match the current \s-1OS\s0
will be tested. If true, all known commands will be tested.
.PP
If no command was found, returns \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If a command is found, returns the exit code of the execution attempt, 0
for success. See the \f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR for more information about this
exit code.
.PP
If no \f(CW$url\fR is given, an exception will be thrown:
\&\f(CW\*(C`Missing required parameter $url\*(C'\fR.
