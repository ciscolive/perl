.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides three utility subroutines that make it easier to
develop interactive applications...
.ie n .IP """is_interactive()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWis_interactive()\fR" 4
.IX Item "is_interactive()"
This subroutine returns true if \f(CW*ARGV\fR and the currently selected
filehandle (usually \f(CW*STDOUT\fR) are connected to the terminal. The
test is considerably more sophisticated than:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-t *ARGV && \-t *STDOUT
.Ve
.Sp
as it takes into account the magic behaviour of \f(CW*ARGV\fR.
.Sp
You can also pass \f(CW\*(C`is_interactive\*(C'\fR a writable filehandle, in which case it
requires that filehandle be connected to a terminal (instead of the
currently selected).  The usual suspect here is \f(CW*STDERR\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    if ( is_interactive(*STDERR) ) {
\&        carp $warning;
\&    }
.Ve
.ie n .IP """interactive()""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWinteractive()\fR" 4
.IX Item "interactive()"
This subroutine returns \f(CW*STDOUT\fR if \f(CW\*(C`is_interactive\*(C'\fR is true. If
\&\f(CW\*(C`is_interactive()\*(C'\fR is false, \f(CW\*(C`interactive\*(C'\fR returns a filehandle that
does not print.
.Sp
This makes it easy to create applications that print out only when the
application is interactive:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    print {interactive} "Please enter a value: ";
\&    my $value = <>;
.Ve
.Sp
You can also pass \f(CW\*(C`interactive\*(C'\fR a writable filehandle, in which case it
writes to that filehandle if it is connected to a terminal (instead of
writing to \f(CW*STDOUT\fR). Once again, the usual suspect is \f(CW*STDERR\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    print {interactive(*STDERR)} $warning;
.Ve
.ie n .IP """busy {...}""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWbusy {...}\fR" 4
.IX Item "busy {...}"
This subroutine takes a block as its single argument and executes that block.
Whilst the block is executed, \f(CW*ARGV\fR is temporarily replaced by a closed
filehandle. That is, no input from \f(CW*ARGV\fR is possible in a \f(CW\*(C`busy\*(C'\fR block.
Furthermore, any attempts to send input into the \f(CW\*(C`busy\*(C'\fR block through
\&\f(CW*ARGV\fR is intercepted and a warning message is printed to \f(CW*STDERR\fR.
The \f(CW\*(C`busy\*(C'\fR call returns a filehandle that contains the intercepted input.
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`busy\*(C'\fR block is therefore useful to prevent attempts at input when the
program is busy at some non-interactive task.

This module only exports the three subroutines described above.
You asked for something else. Maybe you misspelled the subroutine you wanted.
