.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
VMware::VIRuntime module provides an interface to discover and interact with
managed objects as specified by VMware Infrastructure \s-1API.\s0  The module provides
views that correspond to managed objec type definitions detailed in reference guide
(available for download with \s-1SDK\s0 package at http://www.vmware.com/download/sdk/).
Managed object views in this runtime module provides access to methods
and properties.
.PP
Object discovery is provided through Vim::find_entity_view subroutine
which allows for constraint based search/filtering of inventory objects
based on filter parameter.
.PP
This modules also provides synchronous version of methods that return
Task object (methods with '_Task' appended to their names). For example,
PowerOnVM_Task method for VirtualMachine view provides PowerOnVM operation
that blocks until task completion.
.PP
The module is built(depends) on Perl binding for \s-1VI API\s0 (VMware::VIStub)
