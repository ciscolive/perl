.SH "Description"
.IX Header "Description"
.SS "Overview"
.IX Subsection "Overview"
This module provides a Perl interface to the amazing Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>, an open source graph visualization tool from \s-1AT&T.\s0
.PP
It is called GraphViz2 so that pre-existing code using (the Perl module) GraphViz continues to work.
.PP
To avoid confusion, when I use GraphViz2 (note the capital V), I'm referring to this Perl module, and
when I use Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> (lower-case v) I'm referring to the underlying tool (which is in fact a set of programs).
.PP
Version 1.00 of GraphViz2 is a complete re-write, by Ron Savage, of GraphViz V 2, which was written by Leon Brocard. The point of the re-write
is to provide access to all the latest options available to users of Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>.
.PP
GraphViz2 V 1 is not backwards compatible with GraphViz V 2, despite the considerable similarity. It was not possible to maintain compatibility
while extending support to all the latest features of Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>.
.PP
To ensure GraphViz2 is a light-weight module, Moo has been used to provide getters and setters,
rather than Moose.
.PP
As of V 2.43, \f(CW\*(C`GraphViz2\*(C'\fR supports image maps, both client and server side.
.PP
See \*(L"Image Maps\*(R" below.
.SS "What is a Graph?"
.IX Subsection "What is a Graph?"
An undirected graph is a collection of nodes optionally linked together with edges.
.PP
A directed graph is the same, except that the edges have a direction, normally indicated by an arrow head.
.PP
A quick inspection of Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>'s gallery <http://www.graphviz.org/gallery/> will show better than words
just how good Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> is, and will reinforce the point that humans are very visual creatures.
.SH "Installation"
.IX Header "Installation"
Of course you need to install \s-1AT&T\s0's Graphviz before using this module.
See <http://www.graphviz.org/download/>.
.SH "Constructor and Initialization"
.IX Header "Constructor and Initialization"
.SS "Calling \fBnew()\fP"
.IX Subsection "Calling new()"
\&\f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR is called as \f(CW\*(C`my($obj) = GraphViz2 \-> new(k1 => v1, k2 => v2, ...)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It returns a new object of type \f(CW\*(C`GraphViz2\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Key-value pairs accepted in the parameter list:
.PP
\fIedge => \f(CI$hashref\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "edge => $hashref"
.PP
The \fIedge\fR key points to a hashref which is used to set default attributes for edges.
.PP
Hence, allowable keys and values within that hashref are anything supported by Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>.
.PP
The default is {}.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
\fIglobal => \f(CI$hashref\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "global => $hashref"
.PP
The \fIglobal\fR key points to a hashref which is used to set attributes for the output stream.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
Valid keys within this hashref are:
.PP
combine_node_and_port
.IX Subsection "combine_node_and_port"
.PP
New in 2.58. It defaults to true, but in due course (currently planned
May 2021) it will default to false. When true, \f(CW\*(C`add_node\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`add_edge\*(C'\fR
will escape only some characters in the label and names, and in particular
the \*(L"from\*(R" and \*(L"to\*(R" parameters on edges will combine the node name
and port in one string, with a \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR in the middle (except for special
treatment of double-colons).
.PP
When the option is false, any name may be given to nodes, and edges can
be created between them. To specify ports, give the additional parameter
of \f(CW\*(C`tailport\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`headport\*(C'\fR. To specify a compass point in addition,
give array-refs with two values for these parameters. Also, \f(CW\*(C`add_node\*(C'\fR's
treatment of labels is more \s-1DWIM,\s0 with \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR etc being transparently
quoted.
.PP
directed => \f(CW$Boolean\fR
.IX Subsection "directed => $Boolean"
.PP
This option affects the content of the output stream.
.PP
directed => 1 outputs 'digraph name {...}', while directed => 0 outputs 'graph name {...}'.
.PP
At the Perl level, directed graphs have edges with arrow heads, such as '\->', while undirected graphs have
unadorned edges, such as '\-\-'.
.PP
The default is 0.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
driver => \f(CW$program_name\fR
.IX Subsection "driver => $program_name"
.PP
This option specifies which external program to run to process the output stream.
.PP
The default is to use File::Which's \fBwhich()\fR method to find the 'dot' program.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
format => \f(CW$string\fR
.IX Subsection "format => $string"
.PP
This option specifies what type of output file to create.
.PP
The default is 'svg'.
.PP
Output formats of the form 'png:gd' etc are also supported, but only the component before
the first ':' is validated by GraphViz2.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
label => \f(CW$string\fR
.IX Subsection "label => $string"
.PP
This option specifies what an edge looks like: '\->' for directed graphs and '\-\-' for undirected graphs.
.PP
You wouldn't normally need to use this option.
.PP
The default is '\->' if directed is 1, and '\-\-' if directed is 0.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
name => \f(CW$string\fR
.IX Subsection "name => $string"
.PP
This option affects the content of the output stream.
.PP
name => 'G666' outputs 'digraph G666 {...}'.
.PP
The default is 'Perl' :\-).
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
record_shape => /^(?:M?record)$/
.IX Subsection "record_shape => /^(?:M?record)$/"
.PP
This option affects the shape of records. The value must be 'Mrecord' or 'record'.
.PP
Mrecords have nice, rounded corners, whereas plain old records have square corners.
.PP
The default is 'Mrecord'.
.PP
See Record shapes <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#record> for details.
.PP
strict => \f(CW$Boolean\fR
.IX Subsection "strict => $Boolean"
.PP
This option affects the content of the output stream.
.PP
strict => 1 outputs 'strict digraph name {...}', while strict => 0 outputs 'digraph name {...}'.
.PP
The default is 0.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
timeout => \f(CW$integer\fR
.IX Subsection "timeout => $integer"
.PP
This option specifies how long to wait for the external program before exiting with an error.
.PP
The default is 10 (seconds).
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
\fIgraph => \f(CI$hashref\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "graph => $hashref"
.PP
The \fIgraph\fR key points to a hashref which is used to set default attributes for graphs.
.PP
Hence, allowable keys and values within that hashref are anything supported by Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>.
.PP
The default is {}.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
\fIlogger => \f(CI$logger_object\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "logger => $logger_object"
.PP
Provides a logger object so \f(CW$logger_object\fR \-> \f(CW$leve\fRl($message) can be called at certain times. Any object with \f(CW\*(C`debug\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`error\*(C'\fR methods
will do, since these are the only levels emitted by this module.
One option is a Log::Handler object.
.PP
Retrieve and update the value with the \fBlogger()\fR method.
.PP
By default (i.e. without a logger object), GraphViz2 prints warning and debug messages to \s-1STDOUT,\s0
and dies upon errors.
.PP
However, by supplying a log object, you can capture these events.
.PP
Not only that, you can change the behaviour of your log object at any time, by calling
\&\*(L"logger($logger_object)\*(R".
.PP
See also the verbose option, which can interact with the logger option.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
\fInode => \f(CI$hashref\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "node => $hashref"
.PP
The \fInode\fR key points to a hashref which is used to set default attributes for nodes.
.PP
Hence, allowable keys and values within that hashref are anything supported by Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>.
.PP
The default is {}.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
\fIsubgraph => \f(CI$hashref\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "subgraph => $hashref"
.PP
The \fIsubgraph\fR key points to a hashref which is used to set attributes for all subgraphs, unless overridden
for specific subgraphs in a call of the form push_subgraph(subgraph => {$attribute => \f(CW$string\fR}).
.PP
Valid keys within this hashref are:
.IP "\(bu" 4
rank => \f(CW$string\fR
.Sp
This option affects the content of all subgraphs, unless overridden later.
.Sp
A typical usage would be new(subgraph => {rank => 'same'}) so that all nodes mentioned within each subgraph
are constrained to be horizontally aligned.
.Sp
See scripts/rank.sub.graph.1.pl for sample code.
.Sp
Possible values for \f(CW$string\fR are: max, min, same, sink and source.
.Sp
See the Graphviz 'rank' docs <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:rank> for details.
.PP
The default is {}.
.PP
This key is optional.
.PP
\fIverbose => \f(CI$Boolean\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "verbose => $Boolean"
.PP
Provides a way to control the amount of output when a logger is not specified.
.PP
Setting verbose to 0 means print nothing.
.PP
Setting verbose to 1 means print the log level and the message to \s-1STDOUT,\s0 when a logger is not specified.
.PP
Retrieve and update the value with the \fBverbose()\fR method.
.PP
The default is 0.
.PP
See also the logger option, which can interact with the verbose option.
.PP
This key is optional.
.SS "Validating Parameters"
.IX Subsection "Validating Parameters"
The secondary keys (under the primary keys 'edge|graph|node') are checked against lists of valid attributes (stored at the end of this
module, after the _\|_DATA_\|_ token, and made available using Data::Section::Simple).
.PP
This mechanism has the effect of hard-coding Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> options in the source code of GraphViz2.
.PP
Nevertheless, the implementation of these lists is handled differently from the way it was done in V 2.
.PP
V 2 ships with a set of scripts, scripts/extract.*.pl, which retrieve pages from the
Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> web site and extract the current lists of valid attributes.
.PP
These are then copied manually into the source code of GraphViz2, meaning any time those lists change on the
Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> web site, it's a trivial matter to update the lists stored within this module.
.PP
See \*(L"Scripts Shipped with this Module\*(R" in GraphViz2.

.Ve
.PP
Takes a Graph object. This module will figure out various defaults from it,
including whether it is directed or not.
.PP
Will also use any node\-, edge\-, and graph-level attributes named
\&\f(CW\*(C`graphviz\*(C'\fR as a hash-ref for setting attributes on the corresponding
entities in the constructed GraphViz2 object. These will override the
figured-out defaults referred to above.
.PP
Will only set the \f(CW\*(C`global\*(C'\fR attribute if called as a constructor. This
will be dropped from any passed-in graph-level \f(CW\*(C`graphviz\*(C'\fR attribute
when called as an object method.
.PP
A special graph-level attribute (under \f(CW\*(C`graphviz\*(C'\fR) called \f(CW\*(C`groups\*(C'\fR will
be given further special meaning: it is an array-ref of hash-refs. Those
will have keys, used to create subgraphs:
.IP "\(bu" 4
attributes
.Sp
Hash-ref of arguments to supply to \f(CW\*(C`push_subgraph\*(C'\fR for this subgraph.
.IP "\(bu" 4
nodes
.Sp
Array-ref of node names to put in this subgraph.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        $g\->set_graph_attribute(graphviz => {
\&                groups => [
\&                        {nodes => [1, 2], attributes => {subgraph=>{rank => \*(Aqsame\*(Aq}}},

\&                # other graph\-level attributes...
\&        });
.Ve
.SH "Attribute Scope"
.IX Header "Attribute Scope"
.SS "Graph Scope"
.IX Subsection "Graph Scope"
The graphical elements graph, node and edge, have attributes. Attributes can be set when calling \fBnew()\fR.
.PP
Within \fBnew()\fR, the defaults are graph => {}, node => {}, and edge => {}.
.PP
You override these with code such as new(edge => {color => 'red'}).
.PP
These attributes are pushed onto a scope stack during \fBnew()\fR's processing of its parameters, and they apply thereafter until changed.
They are the 'current' attributes. They live at scope level 0 (zero).
.PP
You change the 'current' attributes by calling any of the methods default_edge(%hash), default_graph(%hash) and default_node(%hash).
.PP
See scripts/trivial.pl (\*(L"Scripts Shipped with this Module\*(R" in GraphViz2) for an example.
.SS "Subgraph Scope"
.IX Subsection "Subgraph Scope"
When you wish to create a subgraph, you call push_subgraph(%hash). The word push emphasises that you are moving into a new scope,
and that the default attributes for the new scope are pushed onto the scope stack.
.PP
This module, as with Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>, defaults to using inheritance of attributes.
.PP
That means the parent's 'current' attributes are combined with the parameters to push_subgraph(%hash) to generate a new set of 'current'
attributes for each of the graphical elements, graph, node and edge.
.PP
After a single call to push_subgraph(%hash), these 'current' attributes will live a level 1 in the scope stack.
.PP
See scripts/sub.graph.pl (\*(L"Scripts Shipped with this Module\*(R" in GraphViz2) for an example.
.PP
Another call to push_subgraph(%hash), \fIwithout\fR an intervening call to \fBpop_subgraph()\fR, will repeat the process, leaving you with
a set of attributes at level 2 in the scope stack.
.PP
Both GraphViz2 and Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> handle this situation properly.
.PP
See scripts/sub.sub.graph.pl (\*(L"Scripts Shipped with this Module\*(R" in GraphViz2) for an example.
.PP
At the moment, due to design defects (\s-1IMHO\s0) in the underlying Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> logic, there are some tiny problems with this:
.IP "\(bu" 4
A global frame
.Sp
I can't see how to make the graph as a whole (at level 0 in the scope stack) have a frame.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Frame color
.Sp
When you specify graph => {color => 'red'} at the parent level, the subgraph has a red frame.
.Sp
I think a subgraph should control its own frame.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Parent and child frames
.Sp
When you specify graph => {color => 'red'} at the subgraph level, both that subgraph and it children have red frames.
.Sp
This contradicts what happens at the global level, in that specifying color there does not given the whole graph a frame.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Frame visibility
.Sp
A subgraph whose name starts with 'cluster' is currently forced to have a frame, unless you rig it by specifying a
color the same as the background.
.Sp
For sample code, see scripts/sub.graph.frames.pl.
.PP
Also, check the pencolor docs <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html#d:pencolor> for how the color of the frame is
chosen by cascading thru a set of options.
.PP
I've posted an email to the Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> mailing list suggesting a new option, framecolor, so deal with
this issue, including a special color of 'invisible'.
.SH "Image Maps"
.IX Header "Image Maps"
As of V 2.43, \f(CW\*(C`GraphViz2\*(C'\fR supports image maps, both client and server side.
For web use, note that these options also take effect when generating SVGs,
for a much lighter-weight solution to hyperlinking graph nodes and edges.
.SS "The Default \s-1URL\s0"
.IX Subsection "The Default URL"
See the Graphviz docs for 'cmapx' <http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/output.html#d:cmapx>.
.PP
Their sample code has a dot file \- x.gv \- containing this line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        URL="http://www.research.att.com/base.html";
.Ve
.PP
The way you set such a url in \f(CW\*(C`GraphViz2\*(C'\fR is via a new parameter to \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR. This parameter is called \f(CW\*(C`im_meta\*(C'\fR
and it takes a hashref as a value. Currently the only key used within that hashref is the case-sensitive \f(CW\*(C`URL\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Thus you must do this to set a \s-1URL:\s0
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        my($graph) = GraphViz2 \-> new
\&                     (

\&                        },

Let me repeat \- that is Graphviz syntax, not GraphViz2 syntax. In Perl, you must do this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $graph \-> add_edge(from => \*(Aqstruct1:f1\*(Aq, to => \*(Aqstruct2:f0\*(Aq, color => \*(Aqblue\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
You don't have to quote all node names in Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>, but some, such as digits, must be quoted, so I've decided to quote them all.
.SS "How labels interact with ports"
.IX Subsection "How labels interact with ports"
You can specify labels with ports in these ways:
.IP "\(bu" 4
As a string
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $graph \-> add_node(name => \*(Aqstruct3\*(Aq, label => "hello\enworld |{ b |{c|<here> d|e}| f}| g | h");
.Ve
.Sp
Here, the string contains a port (<here>), field markers (|), and orientation markers ({}).
.Sp
Clearly, you must specify the field separator character '|' explicitly. In the next 2 cases, it is implicit.
.Sp
Then you use \f(CW$graph\fR \-> add_edge(...) to refer to those ports, if desired:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $graph \-> add_edge(from => \*(Aqstruct1:f2\*(Aq, to => \*(Aqstruct3:here\*(Aq, color => \*(Aqred\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
The same label is specified in the next case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
As an arrayref of hashrefs
.Sp
From scripts/record.2.pl:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        $graph \-> add_node(name => \*(Aqstruct3\*(Aq, label =>
\&        [
\&                {
\&                        text => "hello\enworld",
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        text => \*(Aq{b\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        text => \*(Aq{c\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        port => \*(Aq<here>\*(Aq,
\&                        text => \*(Aqd\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        text => \*(Aqe}\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        text => \*(Aqf}\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        text => \*(Aqg\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&                {
\&                        text => \*(Aqh\*(Aq,
\&                },
\&        ]);
.Ve
.Sp
Each hashref is a field, and hence you do not specify the field separator character '|'.
.Sp
Then you use \f(CW$graph\fR \-> add_edge(...) to refer to those ports, if desired. Again, from scripts/record.2.pl:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $graph \-> add_edge(from => \*(Aqstruct1:f2\*(Aq, to => \*(Aqstruct3:here\*(Aq, color => \*(Aqred\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
The same label is specified in the previous case.
.IP "\(bu" 4
As an arrayref of strings
.Sp
From scripts/html.labels.1.pl:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        $graph \-> add_node(name => \*(AqOakleigh\*(Aq, shape => \*(Aqrecord\*(Aq, color => \*(Aqblue\*(Aq,
\&                label => [\*(AqWest Oakleigh\*(Aq, \*(AqEast Oakleigh\*(Aq]);
.Ve
.Sp
Here, again, you do not specify the field separator character '|'.
.Sp
What happens is that each string is taken to be the label of a field, and each field is given
an auto-generated port name of the form \*(L"<port$n>\*(R", where \f(CW$n\fR starts from 1.
.Sp
Here's how you refer to those ports, again from scripts/html.labels.1.pl:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        $graph \-> add_edge(from => \*(AqMurrumbeena\*(Aq, to => \*(AqOakleigh:port2\*(Aq,
\&                color => \*(Aqgreen\*(Aq, label => \*(Aq<Drive<br/>Run<br/>Sprint>\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
See also the docs for the \f(CW\*(C`add_node(name => $node_name, [%hash])\*(C'\fR method.
.SS "Attributes for clusters"
.IX Subsection "Attributes for clusters"
Just use subgraph => {...}, because the code (as of V 2.22) accepts attributes belonging to either clusters or subgraphs.
.PP
An example attribute is \f(CW\*(C`pencolor\*(C'\fR, which is used for clusters but not for subgraphs:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        $graph\->push_subgraph(
\&                graph    => {label => \*(AqChild the Second\*(Aq},
\&                name     => \*(Aqcluster Second subgraph\*(Aq,
\&                node     => {color => \*(Aqmagenta\*(Aq, shape => \*(Aqdiamond\*(Aq},
\&                subgraph => {pencolor => \*(Aqwhite\*(Aq}, # White hides the cluster\*(Aqs frame.
\&        );
\&        # other nodes or edges can be added within it...
\&        $graph\->pop_subgraph;
.Ve
.SH "TODO"
.IX Header "TODO"
.IP "\(bu" 4
Handle edges such as 1 \-> 2 \-> {A B}, as seen in Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>'s graphs/directed/switch.gv
.Sp
But how?
.IP "\(bu" 4
Validate parameters more carefully, e.g. to reject non-hashref arguments where appropriate
.Sp
Some method parameter lists take keys whose value must be a hashref.
