.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
.SS "\fBanswer()\fP"
.IX Subsection "answer()"
One of the most used methods, waits for an answer from the device. It waits until
\&\f(CW$timeout\fR (seconds) is reached (but don't rely on this time to be very correct) or until an
expected string is encountered. Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $answer = $modem\->answer( [$expect [, $timeout]] )
.Ve
.PP
Returns \f(CW$answer\fR that is the string received from modem stripped of all
\&\fBCarriage Return\fR and \fBLine Feed\fR chars \fBonly\fR at the beginning and at the end of the
string. No in-between \fB\s-1CR+LF\s0\fR are stripped.
.PP
Note that if you need the raw answer from the modem, you can use the \fB_answer()\fR (note
that underscore char before answer) method, which does not strip anything from the response,
so you get the real modem answer string.
.PP
Parameters:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$expect\fR \- Can be a regexp compiled with \f(CW\*(C`qr\*(C'\fR or a simple substring. Input coming from the
modem is matched against this parameter. If input matches, result is returned.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW$timeout\fR \- Expressed in milliseconds. After that time, answer returns result also if nothing
has been received. Example: \f(CW10000\fR. Default: \f(CW$Device::Modem::TIMEOUT\fR, currently 500 ms.
.SS "\fBatsend()\fP"
.IX Subsection "atsend()"
Sends a raw \f(CW\*(C`AT\*(C'\fR command to the device connected. Note that this method is most used
internally, but can be also used to send your own custom commands. Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->atsend( $msg )
.Ve
.PP
The only parameter is \f(CW$msg\fR, that is the raw \s-1AT\s0 command to be sent to
modem expressed as string. You must include the \f(CW\*(C`AT\*(C'\fR prefix and final
\&\fBCarriage Return\fR and/or \fBLine Feed\fR manually. There is the special constant
\&\f(CW\*(C`CR\*(C'\fR that can be used to include such a char sequence into the at command.
.PP
Returns \f(CW$ok\fR flag that is true if all characters are sent successfully, false
otherwise.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Enable verbose messages
\&        $modem\->atsend( \*(AqAT V1\*(Aq . Device::Modem::CR );
\&
\&        # The same as:
\&        $modem\->verbose(1);
.Ve
.SS "\fBattention()\fP"
.IX Subsection "attention()"
This command sends an \fBattention\fR sequence to modem. This allows modem
to pass in \fBcommand state\fR and accept \fB\s-1AT\s0\fR commands. Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->attention()
.Ve
.SS "\fBconnect()\fP"
.IX Subsection "connect()"
Connects \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR object to the specified serial port.
There are options (the same options that \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR has) to control
the parameters associated to serial link. Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->connect( [%options] )
.Ve
.PP
List of allowed options follows:
.ie n .IP """baudrate""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWbaudrate\fR" 4
.IX Item "baudrate"
Controls the speed of serial communications. The default is \fB19200\fR baud, that should
be supported by all modern modems. However, here you can supply a custom value.
Common speed values: 300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600,
115200.
This parameter is handled directly by \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR object.
.ie n .IP """databits""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWdatabits\fR" 4
.IX Item "databits"
This tells how many bits your data word is composed of.
Default (and most common setting) is \f(CW8\fR.
This parameter is handled directly by \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR object.
.ie n .IP """handshake""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWhandshake\fR" 4
.IX Item "handshake"
Sets the handshake (or flow control) method for the serial port.
By default it is \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, but can be either \f(CW\*(C`rts\*(C'\fR (hardware flow control)
or \f(CW\*(C`xoff\*(C'\fR (software flow control). These flow control modes may or may not
work depending on your modem device or software.
.ie n .IP """init_string""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWinit_string\fR" 4
.IX Item "init_string"
Custom initialization string can be supplied instead of the built-in one, that is the
following: \f(CW\*(C`H0 Z S7=45 S0=0 Q0 V1 E0 &C0 X4\*(C'\fR, that is taken shamelessly from
\&\f(CW\*(C`minicom\*(C'\fR utility, I think.
.ie n .IP """parity""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWparity\fR" 4
.IX Item "parity"
Controls how parity bit is generated and checked.
Can be \fBeven\fR, \fBodd\fR or \fBnone\fR. Default is \fBnone\fR.
This parameter is handled directly by \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR object.
.ie n .IP """stopbits""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWstopbits\fR" 4
.IX Item "stopbits"
Tells how many bits are used to identify the end of a data word.
Default (and most common usage) is \f(CW1\fR.
This parameter is handled directly by \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR object.
.SS "\fBdial()\fP"
.IX Subsection "dial()"
Dials a telephone number. Can perform both voice and data calls.
.PP
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        $ok = $modem\->dial($number);
\&    $ok = $modem\->dial($number, $timeout);
\&    $ok = $modem\->dial($number, $timeout, $mode);
.Ve
.PP
Takes the modem off hook, dials the specified number and returns
modem answer.
.PP
Regarding voice calls, you \fBwill not\fR be able to send your voice through.
You probably have to connect an analog microphone, and just speak.
Or use a \s-1GSM\s0 phone. For voice calls, a simple \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR is appended to the
number to be dialed.
.PP
If the number to dial is 1 digit only, extracts the number from the address book, provided your device has one. See \f(CW\*(C`store_number()\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Simple usage. Timeout and mode are optional.
\&    $ok = $mode\->dial(\*(Aq123456789\*(Aq);
\&
\&        # List context: allows to get at exact modem answer
\&        # like \`CONNECT 19200/...\*(Aq, \`BUSY\*(Aq, \`NO CARRIER\*(Aq, ...
\&    # Also, 30 seconds timeout
\&        ($ok, $answer) = $modem\->dial(\*(Aq123456789\*(Aq, 30);
.Ve
.PP
If called in \fBscalar context\fR, returns only success of connection.
If modem answer contains the \f(CW\*(C`CONNECT\*(C'\fR string, \f(CW\*(C`dial()\*(C'\fR returns
successful state, otherwise a false value is returned.
.PP
If called in \fBlist context\fR, returns the same \f(CW$ok\fR flag, but also the
exact modem answer to the dial operation in the \f(CW$answer\fR scalar.
\&\f(CW$answer\fR typically can contain strings like:
.ie n .IP """CONNECT 19200""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWCONNECT 19200\fR" 4
.IX Item "CONNECT 19200"
.PD 0
.ie n .IP """NO CARRIER""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWNO CARRIER\fR" 4
.IX Item "NO CARRIER"
.ie n .IP """BUSY""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWBUSY\fR" 4
.IX Item "BUSY"
.PD
.PP
and so on ... all standard modem answers to a dial command.
.PP
Parameters are:
.ie n .IP "$number" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$number\fR" 4
.IX Item "$number"
\&\fBmandatory\fR, this is the phone number to dial.
If \f(CW$number\fR is only 1 digit, it is interpreted as:
\&\fBdial number in my address book position \f(CB$number\fB\fR.
.Sp
So if your code is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $modem\->dial( 2, 10 );
.Ve
.Sp
This means: dial number in the modem internal address book
(see \f(CW\*(C`store_number\*(C'\fR for a way to read/write address book)
in position number \fB2\fR and wait for a timeout of \fB10\fR seconds.
.ie n .IP "$timeout" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$timeout\fR" 4
.IX Item "$timeout"
\&\fBoptional\fR, default is \fB30 seconds\fR.
.Sp
Timeout expressed in seconds to wait for the remote device
to answer. Please do not expect an \fBexact\fR wait for the number of
seconds you specified.
.ie n .IP "$mode" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "$mode"
\&\fBoptional\fR, default is \f(CW\*(C`DATA\*(C'\fR, as string.
Allows to specify the type of call. Can be either:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP """DATA"" (default)" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWDATA\fR (default)" 4
.IX Item "DATA (default)"
To perform a \fBdata call\fR.
.ie n .IP """VOICE""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWVOICE\fR" 4
.IX Item "VOICE"
To perform a \fBvoice call\fR, if your device supports it.
No attempt to verify whether your device can do that will be made.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.SS "\fBdisconnect()\fP"
.IX Subsection "disconnect()"
Disconnects \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR object from serial port. This method calls underlying
\&\f(CW\*(C`disconnect()\*(C'\fR of \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR object.
Example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $modem\->disconnect();
.Ve
.SS "\fBecho()\fP"
.IX Subsection "echo()"
Enables or disables local echo of commands. This is managed automatically by \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR
object. Normally you should not need to worry about this. Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->echo( $enable )
.Ve
.SS "\fBhangup()\fP"
.IX Subsection "hangup()"
Does what it is supposed to do. Hang up the phone thus terminating any active call.
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->hangup();
.Ve
.SS "\fBis_active()\fP"
.IX Subsection "is_active()"
Can be used to check if there is a modem attached to your computer.
If modem is alive and responding (on serial link, not to a remote call),
\&\f(CW\*(C`is_active()\*(C'\fR returns true (1), otherwise returns false (0).
.PP
Test of modem activity is done through \s-1DSR\s0 (Data Set Ready) signal. If
this signal is in off state, modem is probably turned off, or not working.
From my tests I've found that \s-1DSR\s0 stays in \*(L"on\*(R" state after more or less
one second I turn off my modem, so know you know that.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        if( $modem\->is_active() ) {
\&                # Ok!
\&        } else {
\&                # Modem turned off?
\&        }
.Ve
.SS "\fBlog()\fP"
.IX Subsection "log()"
Simple accessor to log object instanced at object creation time.
Used internally. If you want to know the gory details, see \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem::Log::*\*(C'\fR objects.
You can also see the \fBexamples\fR for how to log something without knowing
all the gory details.
.PP
Hint:
	\f(CW$modem\fR\->log\->write('warning', 'ok, my log message here');
.SS "\fBnew()\fP"
.IX Subsection "new()"
\&\f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR constructor. This takes several options. A basic example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $modem = Device::Modem\->new( port => \*(Aq/dev/ttyS0\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
if under Linux or some kind of unix machine, or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $modem = Device::Modem\->new( port => \*(AqCOM1\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
if you are using a Win32 machine.
.PP
This builds the \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR object with all the default parameters.
This should be fairly usable if you want to connect to a real modem.
Note that I'm testing it with a \fB3Com \s-1US\s0 Robotics 56K Message\fR modem
at \fB19200\fR baud and works ok.
.PP
List of allowed options:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`port\*(C'\fR \- serial port to connect to. On Unix, can be also a convenient link as
\&\fI/dev/modem\fR (the default value). For Win32, \f(CW\*(C`COM1,2,3,4\*(C'\fR can be used.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR \- this specifies the method and eventually the filename for logging.
Logging process with \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR is controlled by \fBlog plugins\fR, stored under
\&\fIDevice/Modem/Log/\fR folder. At present, there are two main plugins: \f(CW\*(C`Syslog\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`File\*(C'\fR.
\&\f(CW\*(C`Syslog\*(C'\fR does not work with Win32 machines.
When using \f(CW\*(C`File\*(C'\fR plug-in, all log information will be written to a default filename
if you don't specify one yourself. The default is \fI\f(CI%WINBOOTDIR\fI%\etemp\emodem.log\fR on
Win32 and \fI/var/log/modem.log\fR on Unix.
.Sp
Also there is the possibility to pass a \fBcustom log object\fR, if this object
provides the following \f(CW\*(C`write()\*(C'\fR call:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $log_object\->write( $loglevel, $logmessage )
.Ve
.Sp
You can simply pass this object (already instanced) as the \f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR property.
.Sp
Examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # For Win32, default is to log in "%WINBOOTDIR%/temp/modem.log" file
\&        my $modem = Device::Modem\->new( port => \*(AqCOM1\*(Aq );
\&
\&        # Unix, custom logfile
\&        my $modem = Device::Modem\->new( port => \*(Aq/dev/ttyS0\*(Aq, log => \*(Aqfile,/home/neo/matrix.log\*(Aq )
\&
\&        # With custom log object
\&        my $modem = Device::modem\->new( port => \*(Aq/dev/ttyS0\*(Aq, log => My::LogObj\->new() );
.Ve
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`loglevel\*(C'\fR \- default logging level. One of (order of decrescent verbosity): \f(CW\*(C`debug\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`verbose\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`notice\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`warning\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`err\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`crit\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`alert\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`emerg\*(C'\fR.
.SS "\fBoffhook()\fP"
.IX Subsection "offhook()"
Takes the modem \*(L"off hook\*(R", ready to dial. Normally you don't need to use this.
Also \f(CW\*(C`dial()\*(C'\fR goes automatically off hook before dialing.
.SS "\fBparse_answer()\fP"
.IX Subsection "parse_answer()"
This method works like \f(CW\*(C`answer()\*(C'\fR, it accepts the same parameters, but it
does not return the raw modem answer. Instead, it returns the answer string
stripped of all \fB\s-1CR\s0\fR/\fB\s-1LF\s0\fR characters at the beginning \fBand\fR at the end.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`parse_answer()\*(C'\fR is meant as an easy way of extracting result code
(\f(CW\*(C`OK\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ERROR\*(C'\fR, ...) and information strings that can be sent by modem
in response to specific commands. Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        > AT xSHOW_MODELx<CR>
\&        US Robotics 56K Message
\&        OK
\&        >
.Ve
.PP
In this example, \f(CW\*(C`OK\*(C'\fR is the result and \f(CW\*(C`US Robotics 56K Message\*(C'\fR is the
informational message.
.PP
In fact, another difference with \f(CW\*(C`answer()\*(C'\fR is in the return value(s).
Here are some examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        $modem\->atsend( \*(Aq?my_at_command?\*(Aq );
\&        $answer = $modem\->parse_answer();
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW$answer\fR is the complete response string, or:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ($result, @lines) = $modem\->parse_answer();
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW$result\fR is the \f(CW\*(C`OK\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`ERROR\*(C'\fR final message and \f(CW@lines\fR is
the array of information messages (one or more lines). For the \fImodel\fR example,
\&\f(CW$result\fR would hold "\f(CW\*(C`OK\*(C'\fR" and \f(CW@lines\fR would consist of only 1 line with
the string "\f(CW\*(C`US Robotics 56K Message\*(C'\fR".
.SS "\fBport()\fP"
.IX Subsection "port()"
Used internally. Accesses the \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR underlying object. If you need to
experiment or do low-level serial calls, you may want to access this. Please report
any usage of this kind, because probably (?) it is possible to include it in a higher
level method.
.PP
As of 1.52, \f(CW\*(C`port()\*(C'\fR will automatically try to reconnect if it detects
a bogus underlying port object. It will reconnect with the same options used
when \f(CW\*(C`connect()\*(C'\fRing the first time.
.PP
If no connection has taken place yet, then \fBno attempt to automatically reconnect\fR
will be attempted.
.SS "\fBrepeat()\fP"
.IX Subsection "repeat()"
Repeats the last \f(CW\*(C`AT\*(C'\fR command issued.
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->repeat()
.Ve
.SS "\fBreset()\fP"
.IX Subsection "reset()"
Tries in any possible way to reset the modem to the starting state, hanging up all
active calls, resending the initialization string and preparing to receive \f(CW\*(C`AT\*(C'\fR
commands.
.SS "\fBrestore_factory_settings()\fP"
.IX Subsection "restore_factory_settings()"
Restores the modem default factory settings. There are normally two main \*(L"profiles\*(R",
two different memories for all modem settings, so you can load profile 0 and profile 1,
that can be different depending on your modem manufacturer.
.PP
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->restore_factory_settings( [$profile] )
.Ve
.PP
If no \f(CW$profile\fR is supplied, \f(CW0\fR is assumed as default value.
.PP
Check on your modem hardware manual for the meaning of these \fBprofiles\fR.
.SS "\fBS_register()\fP"
.IX Subsection "S_register()"
Gets or sets an \fBS register\fR value. These are some internal modem registers that
hold important information that controls all modem behaviour. If you don't know
what you are doing, don't use this method. Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $value = $modem\->S_register( $reg_number [, $new_value] );
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW$reg_number\fR ranges from 0 to 99 (sure?).
If no \f(CW$new_value\fR is supplied, return value is the current register value.
If a \f(CW$new_value\fR is supplied (you want to set the register value), return value
is the new value or \f(CW\*(C`undef\*(C'\fR if there was an error setting the new value.
.PP
<!\-\- Qui &egrave; spiegata da cani \-\->
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Get value of S7 register
\&        $modem\->S_register(7);
\&
\&        # Set value of S0 register to 0
\&        $modem\->S_register(0, 0);
.Ve
.SS "\fBsend_init_string()\fP"
.IX Subsection "send_init_string()"
Sends the initialization string to the connected modem. Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->send_init_string( [$init_string] );
.Ve
.PP
If you specified an \f(CW\*(C`init_string\*(C'\fR as an option to \f(CW\*(C`new()\*(C'\fR object constructor,
that is taken by default to initialize the modem.
Else you can specify \f(CW$init_string\fR parameter to use your own custom initialization
string. Be careful!
.SS "\fBstatus()\fP"
.IX Subsection "status()"
Returns status of main modem signals as managed by \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`Win32::SerialPort\*(C'\fR) objects.
The signals reported are:
.IP "\s-1CTS\s0" 4
.IX Item "CTS"
Clear to send
.IP "\s-1DSR\s0" 4
.IX Item "DSR"
Data set ready
.IP "\s-1RING\s0" 4
.IX Item "RING"
Active if modem is ringing
.IP "\s-1RLSD\s0" 4
.IX Item "RLSD"
??? Released line ???
.PP
Return value of \f(CW\*(C`status()\*(C'\fR call is a hash, where each key is a signal name and
each value is > 0 if signal is active, 0 otherwise.
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        ...
\&        my %sig = $modem\->status();
\&        for (\*(AqCTS\*(Aq,\*(AqDSR\*(Aq,\*(AqRING\*(Aq,\*(AqRLSD\*(Aq) {
\&                print "Signal $_ is ", ($sig{$_} > 0 ? \*(Aqon\*(Aq : \*(Aqoff\*(Aq), "\en";
\&        }
.Ve
.SS "\fBstore_number()\fP"
.IX Subsection "store_number()"
Store telephone number in modem internal address book, to be dialed later (see \f(CW\*(C`dial()\*(C'\fR method).
Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->store_number( $position, $number )
.Ve
.PP
where \f(CW$position\fR is the address book memory slot to store phone number (usually from 0 to 9),
and \f(CW$number\fR is the number to be stored in the slot.
Return value is true if operation was successful, false otherwise.
.SS "\fBverbose()\fP"
.IX Subsection "verbose()"
Enables or disables verbose messages. This is managed automatically by \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR
object. Normally you should not need to worry about this. Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $ok = $modem\->verbose( $enable )
.Ve
.SS "\fBwait()\fP"
.IX Subsection "wait()"
Waits (yea) for a given amount of time (in milliseconds). Usage:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        $modem\->wait( [$msecs] )
.Ve
.PP
Wait is implemented via \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR system call.
Don't know if this is really a problem on some platforms.
.SS "\fBwrite_drain()\fP"
.IX Subsection "write_drain()"
Only a simple wrapper around \f(CW\*(C`Device::SerialPort::write_drain\*(C'\fR method.
Disabled for Win32 platform, that doesn't have that.

.SH "TO-DO"
.IX Header "TO-DO"
.IP "AutoScan" 4
.IX Item "AutoScan"
An \s-1AT\s0 command script with all interesting commands is run
when `autoscan' is invoked, creating a `profile' of the
current device, with list of supported commands, and database
of brand/model\-specific commands
.IP "Serial speed auto-detect" 4
.IX Item "Serial speed auto-detect"
Now if you connect to a different baud rate than that of your modem,
probably you will get no response at all. It would be nice if \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR
could auto-detect the speed to correctly connect at your modem.
.IP "File transfers" 4
.IX Item "File transfers"
It would be nice to implement \f(CW\*(C`[xyz]modem\*(C'\fR like transfers between
two \f(CW\*(C`Device::Modem\*(C'\fR objects connected with two modems.
