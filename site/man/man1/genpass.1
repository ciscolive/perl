.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgenpass\fR creates passwords in a fast and comfortable maner. The idea is to be
able to do plenty without necessarily needing to.
.PP
The way \fBgenpass\fR works is by compiling a list of known characters by types
(numerical, lowercase, uppercase, etc.) and a list of unreadable characters \-
which are basically characters that can be confused with each other (0, O, I, l,
1 and so on). It generates a random by possible characters, excluding the
non-readable ones, if any exist.
.PP
\&\fBgenpass\fR allows you to pick which characters it will use to create the
passwords via the longer options for \fIlowercase\fR, \fIuppercase\fR,
\&\fInumerical\fR, \fIspecials\fR and \fIunreadable\fR.
.PP
Also, any boolean option (readable, special) can be negated using \*(L"no\*(R", such as
\&\fIgenpass \-\-nospecial\fR which negates \fIgenpass \-\-special\fR.
.PP
\&\fBgenpass\fR also supports configuration files, so you don't have to remember all
your favorite options and insert them each time. First it tries to read a
\&\f(CW\*(C`.genpass.yaml\*(C'\fR in your home folder (works with Linux, \s-1BSD,\s0 MacOS, Windows and
anything File::HomeDir supports) and if that doesn't exist (or is simply
unreadable), it looks for a global Unix-style conf named \f(CW\*(C`/etc/genpass.yaml\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You will read below how you can specifically ask to read a completely different
file instead of the default ones mentioned above.
.PP
Read below for more options and examples.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-configfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--configfile"
\&\fBgenpass\fR can work with most configuration formats, such as \s-1YAML, JSON, INI\s0
(Apache) and so on. You can configure any part of \fBgenpass\fR and ask \fBgenpass\fR
to read a configuration file as such:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-configfile ~/.genpass.yaml
.Ve
.Sp
Or a global one as such:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-configfile /etc/genpass.json
.Ve
.Sp
Default: \fIYourHomeFolder/.genpass.yaml\fR, then \fI/etc/genpass.yaml\fR.
.IP "\fB\-r | \-\-readable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r | --readable"
A flag to decide whether passwords should be readable. The purpose of
readability is to create passwords you can give to users or read to someone \-
both of which aren't necessarily good practices, but commonly used.
.Sp
Readable passwords do not contain the additional type of special characters,
which is something to consider. Sometimes it doesn't matter as much (such as a
Windows user on a local \s-1LAN\s0 machine that has no critical data or access
anywhere.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-readable
.Ve
.Sp
Since \fIreadable\fR is on by default, you can negate this if you want by using
the \fInoreadable\fR option:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-noreadable
.Ve
.Sp
This will turn on the special and possibly unreadable characters option.
.Sp
Please view \fIunreadable\fR below for more details.
.Sp
Default: on.
.IP "\fB\-l | \-\-length\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l | --length"
The length of the password.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # create a 50 character long password
\&    genpass \-\-length 50
\&
\&    # create a 7 character long password
\&    genpass \-l 7
.Ve
.Sp
If your configuration requires a certain variety of characters but you've asked
for a shorter password (one which cannot contain that variety), \fBgenpass\fR will
complain and try to explain what the problem is.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $ genpass \-l 2
\&    You wanted a longer password that the variety of characters you\*(Aqve selected.
\&    You requested 3 types of characters but only have 2 length.
.Ve
.Sp
Default: 10.
.IP "\fB\-n | \-\-number\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n | --number"
How many passwords to create.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    # generate 30 passwords
\&    genpass \-n 30
.Ve
.Sp
Default: 1.
.IP "\fB\-s | \-\-special\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s | --special"
Indicates whether to use special characters or not. This basically means symbols
such as period, exclamation mark, percentage sign, etc.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-special
.Ve
.Sp
You can negate this flag by doing:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-nospecial
.Ve
.Sp
Default: no.
.IP "\fB\-v | \-\-verify\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v | --verify"
Whether to verify that the variety of characters you requested is included.
.Sp
Disabling this gains you speed if you create a rather large number of passwords
that have a rather large number of characters. Then you don't need to worry as
much about having that variety since probability says you probably will.
.Sp
You can negate this using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    genpass \-\-noverify
.Ve
.Sp
Best to keep it on though.
.Sp
Default: yes.
.IP "\fB\-\-lowercase\fR" 4
.IX Item "--lowercase"
Which characters are considered lowercase?
.IP "\fB\-\-uppercase\fR" 4
.IX Item "--uppercase"
Which characters are considered uppercase?
.IP "\fB\-\-numerical\fR" 4
.IX Item "--numerical"
Which characters are considered numerical?
.IP "\fB\-\-specials\fR" 4
.IX Item "--specials"
Which characters are considered special ones?
.IP "\fB\-\-unreadable\fR" 4
.IX Item "--unreadable"
Which characters are considered unreadable?
.Sp
This includes a short list of characters that are easily confused and the above
sequences are stripped of such characters.

\&
\&    # create 5 new passwords of length of 30, long options
