.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 2
\&    ack [options] PATTERN [FILE...]
\&    ack \-f [options] [DIRECTORY...]
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
ack is designed as an alternative to \fIgrep\fR for programmers.
.PP
ack searches the named input FILEs or DIRECTORYs for lines containing a
match to the given \s-1PATTERN.\s0  By default, ack prints the matching lines.
If no \s-1FILE\s0 or \s-1DIRECTORY\s0 is given, the current directory will be searched.
.PP
\&\s-1PATTERN\s0 is a Perl regular expression.  Perl regular expressions
are commonly found in other programming languages, but for the particulars
of their behavior, please consult
perlreref <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlreref.html>.  If you don't know
how to use regular expression but are interested in learning, you may
consult perlretut <https://perldoc.perl.org/perlretut.html>.  If you do not
need or want ack to use regular expressions, please see the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Q\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`\-\-literal\*(C'\fR option.
.PP
Ack can also list files that would be searched, without actually
searching them, to let you take advantage of ack's file-type filtering
capabilities.
.SH "FILE SELECTION"
.IX Header "FILE SELECTION"
If files are not specified for searching, either on the command
line or piped in with the \f(CW\*(C`\-x\*(C'\fR option, \fIack\fR delves into
subdirectories selecting files for searching.
.PP
\&\fIack\fR is intelligent about the files it searches.  It knows about
certain file types, based on both the extension on the file and,
in some cases, the contents of the file.  These selections can be
made with the \fB\-\-type\fR option.
.PP
With no file selection, \fIack\fR searches through regular files that
are not explicitly excluded by \fB\-\-ignore\-dir\fR and \fB\-\-ignore\-file\fR
options, either present in \fIackrc\fR files or on the command line.
.PP
The default options for \fIack\fR ignore certain files and directories.  These
include:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Backup files: Files matching \fI#*#\fR or ending with \fI~\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Coredumps: Files matching \fIcore.\ed+\fR
.IP "\(bu" 4
Version control directories like \fI.svn\fR and \fI.git\fR.
.PP
Run \fIack\fR with the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-dump\*(C'\fR option to see what settings are set.
.PP
However, \fIack\fR always searches the files given on the command line,
no matter what type.  If you tell \fIack\fR to search in a coredump,
it will search in a coredump.
.SH "DIRECTORY SELECTION"
.IX Header "DIRECTORY SELECTION"
\&\fIack\fR descends through the directory tree of the starting directories
specified.  If no directories are specified, the current working directory is
used.  However, it will ignore the shadow directories used by
many version control systems, and the build directories used by the
Perl MakeMaker system.  You may add or remove a directory from this
list with the \fB\-\-[no]ignore\-dir\fR option. The option may be repeated
to add/remove multiple directories from the ignore list.
.PP
For a complete list of directories that do not get searched, run
\&\f(CW\*(C`ack \-\-dump\*(C'\fR.
.SH "MATCHING IN A RANGE OF LINES"
.IX Header "MATCHING IN A RANGE OF LINES"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-start\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-end\*(C'\fR options let you specify ranges of
lines to search within each file.
.PP
Say you had the following file, called \fItestfile\fR:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    # This function calls print on "foo".
\&    sub foo {
\&        print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&    }
\&    my $print = 1;
\&    sub bar {
\&        print \*(Aqbar\*(Aq;
\&    }
\&    my $task = \*(Aqprint\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Calling \f(CW\*(C`ack print\*(C'\fR will give us five matches:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $ ack print testfile
\&    # This function calls print on "foo".
\&        print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&    my $print = 1;
\&        print \*(Aqbar\*(Aq;
\&    my $task = \*(Aqprint\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
What if we only want to search for \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR within the subroutines?  We can
specify ranges of lines that we want ack to search.  The range starts with
any line that matches the pattern \f(CW\*(C`^sub \ew+\*(C'\fR, and stops with any line that
matches \f(CW\*(C`^}\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ ack \-\-range\-start=\*(Aq^sub \ew+\*(Aq \-\-range\-end=\*(Aq^}\*(Aq print testfile
\&        print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&        print \*(Aqbar\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
Note that ack searched two ranges of lines.  The listing below shows which
lines were in a range and which were out of the range.
.PP
.Vb 9
\&    Out # This function calls print on "foo".
\&    In  sub foo {
\&    In      print \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq;
\&    In  }
\&    Out my $print = 1;
\&    In  sub bar {
\&    In      print \*(Aqbar\*(Aq;
\&    In  }
\&    Out my $task = \*(Aqprint\*(Aq;
.Ve
.PP
You don't have to specify both \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-start\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-end\*(C'\fR.  \s-1IF\s0
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-start\*(C'\fR is omitted, then the range runs from the first line in the
file unitl the first line that matches \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-end\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-end\*(C'\fR is omitted, the range runs from the first line matching
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-start\*(C'\fR to the end of the file.
.PP
For example, if you wanted to search all \s-1HTML\s0 files up until the first
instance of the \f(CW\*(C`<body>\*(C'\fR, you could do
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ack foo \-\-range\-end=\*(Aq<body>\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Or to search after Perl's `_\|_DATA_\|_` or `_\|_END_\|_` markers, you would do
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ack pattern \-\-range\-end=\*(Aq^_\|_(END|DATA)_\|_\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
It's possible for a range to start and stop on the same line.  For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    \-\-range\-start=\*(Aq<title>\*(Aq \-\-range\-end=\*(Aq</title>\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
would match this line as both the start and end of the range, making a
one-line range.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    <title>Page title</title>
.Ve
.PP
Note that the patterns in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-start\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-range\-end\*(C'\fR are not
affected by options like \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-w\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-Q\*(C'\fR that modify the behavior of
the main pattern being matched.
.PP
Again, ranges only affect where matches are looked for.  Everything else in
ack works the same way.  Using \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR option with a range will give a count
of all the matches that appear within those ranges.  The \f(CW\*(C`\-l\*(C'\fR shows those
files that have a match within a range, and the \f(CW\*(C`\-L\*(C'\fR option shows files
that do not have a match within a range.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-v\*(C'\fR option for negating a match works inside the range, too.
To see lines that don't match \*(L"google\*(R" within the \*(L"<head>\*(R" section of
your \s-1HTML\s0 files, you could do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ack google \-v \-\-html \-\-range\-start=\*(Aq<head\*(Aq \-\-range\-end=\*(Aq</head>\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Specifying a range to search does not affect how matches are displayed.
The context for a match will still be the same, and
.PP
Using the context options work the same way, and will show context
lines for matches even if the context lines fall outside the range.
Similarly, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-passthru\*(C'\fR will show all lines in the file, but only show
matches for lines within the range.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-ackrc\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ackrc"
Specifies an ackrc file to load after all others; see \*(L"\s-1ACKRC LOCATION SEMANTICS\*(R"\s0.
.IP "\fB\-A \f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB\fR, \fB\-\-after\-context=\f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A NUM, --after-context=NUM"
Print \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR lines of trailing context after matching lines.
.IP "\fB\-B \f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB\fR, \fB\-\-before\-context=\f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-B NUM, --before-context=NUM"
Print \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR lines of leading context before matching lines.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]break\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]break"
Print a break between results from different files. On by default
when used interactively.
.IP "\fB\-C [\f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB]\fR, \fB\-\-context[=\f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C [NUM], --context[=NUM]"
Print \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR lines (default 2) of context around matching lines.
You can specify zero lines of context to override another context
specified in an ackrc.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-count\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --count"
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for
each input file.  If \fB\-l\fR is in effect, it will only show the
number of lines for each file that has lines matching.  Without
\&\fB\-l\fR, some line counts may be zeroes.
.Sp
If combined with \fB\-h\fR (\fB\-\-no\-filename\fR) ack outputs only one total
count.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]color\fR, \fB\-\-[no]colour\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]color, --[no]colour"
\&\fB\-\-color\fR highlights the matching text.  \fB\-\-nocolor\fR suppresses
the color.  This is on by default unless the output is redirected.
.Sp
On Windows, this option is off by default unless the
Win32::Console::ANSI module is installed or the \f(CW\*(C`ACK_PAGER_COLOR\*(C'\fR
environment variable is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-color\-filename=\f(BIcolor\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--color-filename=color"
Sets the color to be used for filenames.
.IP "\fB\-\-color\-match=\f(BIcolor\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--color-match=color"
Sets the color to be used for matches.
.IP "\fB\-\-color\-colno=\f(BIcolor\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--color-colno=color"
Sets the color to be used for column numbers.
.IP "\fB\-\-color\-lineno=\f(BIcolor\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--color-lineno=color"
Sets the color to be used for line numbers.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]column\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]column"
Show the column number of the first match.  This is helpful for
editors that can place your cursor at a given position.
.IP "\fB\-\-create\-ackrc\fR" 4
.IX Item "--create-ackrc"
Dumps the default ack options to standard output.  This is useful for
when you want to customize the defaults.
.IP "\fB\-\-dump\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dump"
Writes the list of options loaded and where they came from to standard
output.  Handy for debugging.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]env\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]env"
\&\fB\-\-noenv\fR disables all environment processing. No \fI.ackrc\fR is
read and all environment variables are ignored. By default, \fIack\fR
considers \fI.ackrc\fR and settings in the environment.
.IP "\fB\-\-flush\fR" 4
.IX Item "--flush"
\&\fB\-\-flush\fR flushes output immediately.  This is off by default
unless ack is running interactively (when output goes to a pipe or
file).
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
Only print the files that would be searched, without actually doing
any searching.  \s-1PATTERN\s0 must not be specified, or it will be taken
as a path to search.
.IP "\fB\-\-files\-from=\f(BI\s-1FILE\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--files-from=FILE"
The list of files to be searched is specified in \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.  The list of
files are separated by newlines.  If \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR, the list is loaded
from standard input.
.Sp
Note that the list of files is \fBnot\fR filtered in any way.  If you
add \f(CW\*(C`\-\-type=html\*(C'\fR in addition to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-files\-from\*(C'\fR, the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-type\*(C'\fR will
be ignored.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]filter\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]filter"
Forces ack to act as if it were receiving input via a pipe.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]follow\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]follow"
Follow or don't follow symlinks, other than whatever starting files
or directories were specified on the command line.
.Sp
This is off by default.
.IP "\fB\-g \f(BI\s-1PATTERN\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g PATTERN"
Print searchable files where the relative path + filename matches
\&\fI\s-1PATTERN\s0\fR.
.Sp
Note that
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ack \-g foo
.Ve
.Sp
is exactly the same as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    ack \-f | ack foo
.Ve
.Sp
This means that just as ack will not search, for example, \fI.jpg\fR
files, \f(CW\*(C`\-g\*(C'\fR will not list \fI.jpg\fR files either.  ack is not intended
to be a general-purpose file finder.
.Sp
Note also that if you have \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR in your .ackrc that the filenames
to be matched will be case-insensitive as well.
.Sp
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-color\fR to make it easier to
spot the match.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]group\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]group"
\&\fB\-\-group\fR groups matches by file name.  This is the default
when used interactively.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-nogroup\fR prints one result per line, like grep.  This is the
default when output is redirected.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-with\-filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H, --with-filename"
Print the filename for each match. This is the default unless searching
a single explicitly specified file.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-no\-filename\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --no-filename"
Suppress the prefixing of filenames on output when multiple files are
searched.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]heading\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]heading"
Print a filename heading above each file's results.  This is the default
when used interactively.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print a short help statement.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help-types"
Print all known types.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\-colors\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help-colors"
Print a chart of various color combinations.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\-rgb\-colors\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help-rgb-colors"
Like \fB\-\-help\-colors\fR but with more precise \s-1RGB\s0 colors.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-case\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i, --ignore-case"
Ignore case distinctions in \s-1PATTERN.\s0  Overrides \fB\-\-smart\-case\fR and \fB\-I\fR.
.IP "\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-no\-ignore\-case\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I, --no-ignore-case"
Turns on case distinctions in \s-1PATTERN.\s0  Overrides \fB\-\-smart\-case\fR and \fB\-i\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-ack\-defaults\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-ack-defaults"
Tells ack to completely ignore the default definitions provided with ack.
This is useful in combination with \fB\-\-create\-ackrc\fR if you \fIreally\fR want
to customize ack.
.IP "\fB\-\-[no]ignore\-dir=\f(BI\s-1DIRNAME\s0\fB\fR, \fB\-\-[no]ignore\-directory=\f(BI\s-1DIRNAME\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--[no]ignore-dir=DIRNAME, --[no]ignore-directory=DIRNAME"
Ignore directory (as \s-1CVS,\s0 .svn, etc are ignored). May be used
multiple times to ignore multiple directories. For example, mason
users may wish to include \fB\-\-ignore\-dir=data\fR. The \fB\-\-noignore\-dir\fR
option allows users to search directories which would normally be
ignored (perhaps to research the contents of \fI.svn/props\fR directories).
.Sp
The \fI\s-1DIRNAME\s0\fR must always be a simple directory name. Nested
directories like \fIfoo/bar\fR are \s-1NOT\s0 supported. You would need to
specify \fB\-\-ignore\-dir=foo\fR and then no files from any foo directory
are taken into account by ack unless given explicitly on the command
line.
.IP "\fB\-\-ignore\-file=\f(BI\s-1FILTER:ARGS\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--ignore-file=FILTER:ARGS"
Ignore files matching \fI\s-1FILTER:ARGS\s0\fR.  The filters are specified
identically to file type filters as seen in \*(L"Defining your own types\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-known\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k, --known-types"
Limit selected files to those with types that ack knows about.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-files\-with\-matches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --files-with-matches"
Only print the filenames of matching files, instead of the matching text.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-files\-without\-matches\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L, --files-without-matches"
Only print the filenames of files that do \fI\s-1NOT\s0\fR match.
.IP "\fB\-\-match \f(BI\s-1PATTERN\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--match PATTERN"
Specify the \fI\s-1PATTERN\s0\fR explicitly. This is helpful if you don't want to put the
regex as your first argument, e.g. when executing multiple searches over the
same set of files.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    # search for foo and bar in given files

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-m=\f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB\fR, \fB\-\-max\-count=\f(BI\s-1NUM\s0\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m=NUM, --max-count=NUM"
Print only \fI\s-1NUM\s0\fR matches out of each file.  If you want to stop ack
after printing the first match of any kind, use the \fB\-1\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "--man"
Print this manual page.
.IP "\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no\-recurse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --no-recurse"
No descending into subdirectories.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o"
Show only the part of each line matching \s-1PATTERN\s0 (turns off text
highlighting).  This is exactly the same as \f(CW\*(C`\-\-output=$&\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-output=\f(BIexpr\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output=expr"
Output the evaluation of \fIexpr\fR for each line (turns off text
highlighting). If \s-1PATTERN\s0 matches more than once then a line is
output for each non-overlapping match.
.Sp
\&\fIexpr\fR may contain the strings \*(L"\en\*(R", \*(L"\er\*(R" and \*(L"\et\*(R", which will be
expanded to their corresponding characters line feed, carriage return
and tab, respectively.
.Sp
\&\fIexpr\fR may also contain the following Perl special variables:
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "$1 through $9" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$1\fR through \f(CW$9\fR" 4
.IX Item "$1 through $9"
The subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing parentheses.
If your pattern is \f(CW\*(C`(.+) and (.+)\*(C'\fR, and the string is "this and
that', then \f(CW$1\fR is \*(L"this\*(R" and \f(CW$2\fR is \*(L"that\*(R".
.ie n .IP "$_" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$_\fR" 4
.IX Item "$_"
The contents of the line in the file.
.ie n .IP "$." 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$.\fR" 4
.IX Item "$."
The number of the line in the file.
.ie n .IP "$&, ""$\`"" and ""$\*(Aq""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$&\fR, \f(CW$\`\fR and \f(CW$\*(Aq\fR" 4
.IX Item "$&, $ and $"
\&\f(CW$&\fR is the the string matched by the pattern, \f(CW\*(C`$\`\*(C'\fR is what
precedes the match, and \f(CW\*(C`$\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is what follows it.  If the pattern
is \f(CW\*(C`gra(ph|nd)\*(C'\fR and the string is \*(L"lexicographic\*(R", then \f(CW$&\fR is
\&\*(L"graph\*(R", \f(CW\*(C`$\`\*(C'\fR is \*(L"lexico\*(R" and \f(CW\*(C`$\*(Aq\*(C'\fR is \*(L"ic\*(R".
.Sp
Use of these variables in your output will slow down the pattern
matching.
.ie n .IP "$+" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$+\fR" 4
.IX Item "$+"
The match made by the last parentheses that matched in the pattern.
For example, if your pattern is \f(CW\*(C`Version: (.+)|Revision: (.+)\*(C'\fR,
then \f(CW$+\fR will contain whichever set of parentheses matched.
.ie n .IP "$f" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW$f\fR" 4
.IX Item "$f"
\&\f(CW$f\fR is available, in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-output\*(C'\fR only, to insert the filename.
This is a stand-in for the discovered \f(CW$filename\fR usage in old \f(CW\*(C`ack2 \-\-output\*(C'\fR,

The \fI.ackrc\fR file contains command-line options that are prepended
to the command line before processing.  Multiple options may live
on multiple lines.  Lines beginning with a # are ignored.  A \fI.ackrc\fR
might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # Always sort the files

\&    \-\-color

\&    \-\-pager=less \-r
.Ve
.PP
Note that arguments with spaces in them do not need to be quoted,
as they are not interpreted by the shell. Basically, each \fIline\fR
in the \fI.ackrc\fR file is interpreted as one element of \f(CW@ARGV\fR.
.PP
\&\fIack\fR looks in several locations for \fI.ackrc\fR files; the searching
process is detailed in \*(L"\s-1ACKRC LOCATION SEMANTICS\*(R"\s0.  These
files are not considered if \fB\-\-noenv\fR is specified on the command line.
.SH "Defining your own types"
.IX Header "Defining your own types"
ack allows you to define your own types in addition to the predefined
types. This is done with command line options that are best put into
an \fI.ackrc\fR file \- then you do not have to define your types over and
over again. In the following examples the options will always be shown
on one command line so that they can be easily copy & pasted.
.PP
File types can be specified both with the the \fI\-\-type=xxx\fR option,
or the file type as an option itself.  For example, if you create
a filetype of \*(L"cobol\*(R", you can specify \fI\-\-type=cobol\fR or simply
\&\fI\-\-cobol\fR.  File types must be at least two characters long.  This
is why the C language is \fI\-\-cc\fR and the R language is \fI\-\-rr\fR.
.PP
\&\fIack \-\-perl foo\fR searches for foo in all perl files. \fIack \-\-help\-types\fR
tells you, that perl files are files ending
in .pl, .pm, .pod or .t. So what if you would like to include .xs
files as well when searching for \-\-perl files? \fIack \-\-type\-add perl:ext:xs \-\-perl foo\fR
does this for you. \fB\-\-type\-add\fR appends
additional extensions to an existing type.
.PP
If you want to define a new type, or completely redefine an existing
type, then use \fB\-\-type\-set\fR. \fIack \-\-type\-set eiffel:ext:e,eiffel\fR defines
the type \fIeiffel\fR to include files with
the extensions .e or .eiffel. So to search for all eiffel files
containing the word Bertrand use \fIack \-\-type\-set eiffel:ext:e,eiffel \-\-eiffel Bertrand\fR.
As usual, you can also write \fB\-\-type=eiffel\fR
instead of \fB\-\-eiffel\fR. Negation also works, so \fB\-\-noeiffel\fR excludes
all eiffel files from a search. Redefining also works: \fIack \-\-type\-set cc:ext:c,h\fR
and \fI.xs\fR files no longer belong to the type \fIcc\fR.
.PP
When defining your own types in the \fI.ackrc\fR file you have to use
the following:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  \-\-type\-set=eiffel:ext:e,eiffel
.Ve
.PP
or writing on separate lines
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  \-\-type\-set
\&  eiffel:ext:e,eiffel
.Ve
.PP
The following does \fB\s-1NOT\s0\fR work in the \fI.ackrc\fR file:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
In order to see all currently defined types, use \fI\-\-help\-types\fR, e.g.
\&\fIack \-\-type\-set backup:ext:bak \-\-type\-add perl:ext:perl \-\-help\-types\fR
.PP
In addition to filtering based on extension, ack offers additional
filter types.  The generic syntax is
\&\fI\-\-type\-set \s-1TYPE:FILTER:ARGS\s0\fR; \fI\s-1ARGS\s0\fR depends on the value
of \fI\s-1FILTER\s0\fR.
.IP "is:\fI\s-1FILENAME\s0\fR" 4

ack allows customization of the colors it uses when presenting matches
onscreen.  It uses the colors available in Perl's Term::ANSIColor

.PP
.Vb 6

\&    column no.  \-\-color\-colno       ACK COLOR_COLNO     bold yellow
.Ve
.PP
The column number column is only used if the column number is shown because
of the \-\-column option.
.PP
Colors may be specified by command-line option, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`ack \-\-color\-filename=\*(Aqred on_white\*(Aq\*(C'\fR, or by setting an environment
variable, such as \f(CW\*(C`ACK_COLOR_FILENAME=\*(Aqred on_white\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.  Options for colors
can be set in your \s-1ACKRC\s0 file (See \*(L"\s-1THE\s0 .ackrc \s-1FILE\*(R"\s0).
.PP
ack can understand the following colors for the foreground:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white
.Ve
.PP
The optional background color is specified by prepending \*(L"on_\*(R" to one of
the foreground colors:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    on_black on_red on_green on_yellow on_blue on_magenta on_cyan on_white
.Ve
.PP
Each of the foreground colors can be modified with the following
attributes, which may or may not be supported by your terminal:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    bold faint italic underline blink reverse concealed
.Ve
.PP
Any combinations of modifiers can be added to the foreground color. If your
terminal supports it, and you enjoy visual punishment, you can specify:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ack \-\-color\-filename="blink italic underline bold red on_yellow"
.Ve
.PP
For charts of the colors and what they look like, run \f(CW\*(C`ack \-\-help\-colors\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`ack \-\-help\-rgb\-colors\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If the eight standard colors, in their bold, faint and unmodified states,
aren't enough for you to choose from, you can also specify colors by their
\&\s-1RGB\s0 values.  They are specified as \*(L"rgbXYZ\*(R" where X, Y, and Z are values
between 0 and 5 giving the intensity of red, green and blue, respectively.
Therefore, \*(L"rgb500\*(R" is pure red, \*(L"rgb505\*(R" is purple, and so on.
.PP
Background colors can be specified with the \*(L"on_\*(R" prefix prepended on an
\&\s-1RGB\s0 color, so that \*(L"on_rgb505\*(R" would be a purple background.
.PP
The modifier attributes of blink, italic, underscore and so on may or may
not work on the \s-1RGB\s0 colors.

For a chart of the 216 possible \s-1RGB\s0 colors, run \f(CW\*(C`ack \-\-help\-rgb\-colors\*(C'\fR.

Project ackrc
.Sp
Options are then loaded from the project ackrc.  The project ackrc is
the first ackrc file with the name \f(CW\*(C`.ackrc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_ackrc\*(C'\fR, first searching
in the current directory, then the parent directory, then the grandparent
directory, etc.  This can be omitted using \f(CW\*(C`\-\-noenv\*(C'\fR.

\&\-\-ackrc
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-ackrc\*(C'\fR option may be included on the command line to specify an
ackrc file that can override all others.  It is consulted even if \f(CW\*(C`\-\-noenv\*(C'\fR
is present.

.SH "FAQ"
.IX Header "FAQ"
This is the Frequently Asked Questions list for ack.
.SS "Can I stop using grep now?"
.IX Subsection "Can I stop using grep now?"
Many people find \fIack\fR to be better than \fIgrep\fR as an everyday tool
99% of the time, but don't throw \fIgrep\fR away, because there are times
you'll still need it.  For example, you might be looking through huge
log files and not using regular expressions.  In that case, \fIgrep\fR
will probably perform better.
.SS "Why isn't ack finding a match in (some file)?"
.IX Subsection "Why isn't ack finding a match in (some file)?"
First, take a look and see if ack is even looking at the file.  ack is
intelligent in what files it will search and which ones it won't, but
sometimes that can be surprising.
.PP
Use the \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR switch, with no regex, to see a list of files that ack
will search for you.  If your file doesn't show up in the list of files
that \f(CW\*(C`ack \-f\*(C'\fR shows, then ack never looks in it.
.SS "Wouldn't it be great if \fIack\fP did search & replace?"
.IX Subsection "Wouldn't it be great if ack did search & replace?"
No, ack will always be read-only.  Perl has a perfectly good way
to do search & replace in files, using the \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-n\*(C'\fR
switches.
.PP
You can certainly use ack to select your files to update.  For
example, to change all \*(L"foo\*(R" to \*(L"bar\*(R" in all \s-1PHP\s0 files, you can do
this from the Unix shell:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ perl \-i \-p \-e\*(Aqs/foo/bar/g\*(Aq $(ack \-f \-\-php)
.Ve
.SS "Can I make ack recognize \fI.xyz\fP files?"
.IX Subsection "Can I make ack recognize .xyz files?"
Yes!  Please see \*(L"Defining your own types\*(R" in the ack manual.
.SS "Will you make ack recognize \fI.xyz\fP files by default?"
.IX Subsection "Will you make ack recognize .xyz files by default?"
We might, depending on how widely-used the file format is.
.PP
Submit an issue at in the GitHub issue queue at
<https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack3/issues>.  Explain what the file format
is, where we can find out more about it, and what you have been using
in your \fI.ackrc\fR to support it.
.PP
Please do not bother creating a pull request.  The code for filetypes
is trivial compared to the rest of the process we go through.
.SS "Why is it called ack if it's called ack-grep?"
.IX Subsection "Why is it called ack if it's called ack-grep?"
The name of the program is \*(L"ack\*(R".  Some packagers have called it
\&\*(L"ack-grep\*(R" when creating packages because there's already a package
out there called \*(L"ack\*(R" that has nothing to do with this ack.
.PP
I suggest you make a symlink named \fIack\fR that points to \fIack-grep\fR
because one of the crucial benefits of ack is having a name that's
so short and simple to type.
.PP
To do that, run this with \fIsudo\fR or as root:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   ln \-s /usr/bin/ack\-grep /usr/bin/ack
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, you could use a shell alias:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    # bash/zsh
\&    alias ack=ack\-grep
\&
\&    # csh
\&    alias ack ack\-grep
.Ve
.SS "What does \fIack\fP mean?"
.IX Subsection "What does ack mean?"
Nothing.  I wanted a name that was easy to type and that you could
pronounce as a single syllable.
.SS "Can I do multi-line regexes?"
.IX Subsection "Can I do multi-line regexes?"
No, ack does not support regexes that match multiple lines.  Doing
so would require reading in the entire file at a time.
.PP
If you want to see lines near your match, use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-A\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\-B\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-C\*(C'\fR switches for displaying context.
.ie n .SS "Why is ack telling me I have an invalid option when searching for ""+foo""?"
.el .SS "Why is ack telling me I have an invalid option when searching for \f(CW+foo\fP?"
.IX Subsection "Why is ack telling me I have an invalid option when searching for +foo?"
ack treats command line options beginning with \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR as options; if you
would like to search for these, you may prefix your search term with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-\*(C'\fR or
use the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-match\*(C'\fR option.  (However, don't forget that \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR is a regular
expression metacharacter!)
.ie n .SS "Why does ""ack \*(Aq.{40000,}\*(Aq"" fail?  Isn't that a valid regex?"
.el .SS "Why does \f(CW``ack \*(Aq.{40000,}\*(Aq''\fP fail?  Isn't that a valid regex?"
.IX Subsection "Why does ""ack .{40000,}"" fail? Isn't that a valid regex?"
The Perl language limits the repetition quantifier to 32K.  You
can search for \f(CW\*(C`.{32767}\*(C'\fR but not \f(CW\*(C`.{32768}\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .SS "Ack does ""X"" and shouldn't, should it?"
.el .SS "Ack does ``X'' and shouldn't, should it?"
.IX Subsection "Ack does X and shouldn't, should it?"
We try to remain as close to grep's behavior as possible, so when in
doubt, see what grep does!  If there's a mismatch in functionality there,
please submit an issue to GitHub, and/or bring it up on the ack-users
mailing list.
