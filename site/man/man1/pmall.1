.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This program runs through all your installed modules
and tells you what they're for and what version 
number they are at.
.PP
The following options are honored:
.IP "\-v" 4
.IX Item "-v"
give debug info
.IP "\-w" 4
.IX Item "-w"
warn about missing descriptions on modules
.IP "\-a" 4
.IX Item "-a"
include relative paths
.IP "\-s" 4
.IX Item "-s"
sort output within each directory
.SH "HISTORICAL NOTE"
.IX Header "HISTORICAL NOTE"
This program used to be called \fIpmdesc\fR and is included in \fIThe Perl
Cookbook\fR under that name.  However, that name has been usurped by 
a simpler program.
.PP
For example, to find the versions of what is in your site-specific
directory, the simpler \fIpmdesc\fR might be preferred:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    $ pmdesc \`pminst \-s | perl \-lane \*(Aqprint $F[1] if $F[0] =~ /site/\*(Aq\`
\&    XML::Parser::Expat (2.19) \- Lowlevel access to James Clark\*(Aqs expat XML parser
\&    XML::Parser (2.19) \- A perl module for parsing XML documents
.Ve
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
.IX Header "KNOWN BUGS"
This program takes a long time to run.
.PP
Some modules don't work right (\s-1CPAN\s0.pm, ExtUtils) because of noisy things
they do at compile time or poor formatting of the pod.
