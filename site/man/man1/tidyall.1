.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
There are a lot of great code tidiers and validators out there. \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR
makes them available from a single unified interface.
.PP
You can run \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR on a single file or on an entire project hierarchy, and
configure which tidiers/validators are applied to which files. \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will
back up files beforehand, and for efficiency will only consider files that have
changed since they were last processed.
.SS "What's a tidier? What's a validator?"
.IX Subsection "What's a tidier? What's a validator?"
A \fItidier\fR transforms a file so as to improve its appearance without changing
its semantics. Examples include perltidy, podtidy and
js-beautify <https://npmjs.org/package/js-beautify>.
.PP
A \fIvalidator\fR analyzes a file for some definition of correctness. Examples
include perlcritic, podchecker and jshint <http://www.jshint.com/>.
.PP
Many tidiers are also validators, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`perltidy\*(C'\fR will throw an error on badly
formed Perl.
.PP
To use a tidier or validator with \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR it must have a corresponding
plugin class, usually under the prefix \f(CW\*(C`Code::TidyAll::Plugin::\*(C'\fR.  This
distribution comes with plugins for:
.IP "\(bu" 4

.SH "USING TIDYALL"
.IX Header "USING TIDYALL"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR works on a project basis, where a project is just a directory
hierarchy of files. svn or git working directories are typical examples of
projects.
.PP
The top of the project is called the \fIroot directory\fR. In the root directory
you'll need a config file named \f(CW\*(C`tidyall.ini\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.tidyallrc\*(C'\fR; it defines how
various tidiers and validators will be applied to the files in your project.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will find your root directory and config file automatically
depending on how you call it:
.ie n .IP """tidyall file [file...]""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtidyall file [file...]\fR" 4
.IX Item "tidyall file [file...]"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will search upwards from the first file for the conf file.
.ie n .IP """tidyall \-p/\-\-pipe file""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtidyall \-p/\-\-pipe file\fR" 4
.IX Item "tidyall -p/--pipe file"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will search upwards from the specified file for the conf file.
.ie n .IP """tidyall \-a/\-\-all"" or ""tidyall \-s/\-\-svn"" or ""tidyall \-g/\-\-git""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtidyall \-a/\-\-all\fR or \f(CWtidyall \-s/\-\-svn\fR or \f(CWtidyall \-g/\-\-git\fR" 4
.IX Item "tidyall -a/--all or tidyall -s/--svn or tidyall -g/--git"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will search upwards from the current working directory for the conf
file.
.ie n .IP """tidyall \-a \-\-root\-dir dir""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWtidyall \-a \-\-root\-dir dir\fR" 4
.IX Item "tidyall -a --root-dir dir"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will expect to find the conf file in the specified root directory.
.PP
You can also pass \-\-conf\-name to change the name that is searched for, or
\&\-\-conf\-file to specify an explicit path.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
The config file (\f(CW\*(C`tidyall.ini\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`.tidyallrc\*(C'\fR) is in Config::INI format.
Here's a sample:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ignore = **/*.bak
\&
\&    [PerlTidy]
\&    select = **/*.{pl,pm,t}
\&    argv = \-noll \-it=2
\&
\&    [PerlCritic]
\&    select = lib/**/*.pm
\&    ignore = lib/UtterHack.pm lib/OneTime/*.pm
\&    argv = \-severity 3
\&
\&    [PodTidy]
\&    select = lib/**/*.{pm,pod}
.Ve
.PP
In order, the four sections declare:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Always ignore \f(CW\*(C`*.bak\*(C'\fR files.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Apply \f(CW\*(C`PerlTidy\*(C'\fR with settings \*(L"\-noll \-it=2\*(R" to all *.pl, *.pm, and *.t files.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Apply \f(CW\*(C`PerlCritic\*(C'\fR with severity 3 to all Perl modules somewhere underneath
\&\*(L"lib/\*(R", except for \*(L"lib/UtterHack.pm\*(R".
.IP "\(bu" 4
Apply \f(CW\*(C`PodTidy\*(C'\fR with default settings to all *.pm and *.pod files underneath
\&\*(L"lib/\*(R".
.SS "Standard configuration elements"
.IX Subsection "Standard configuration elements"
.IP "[class] or [class description]" 4
.IX Item "[class] or [class description]"
The header of each section refers to a tidyall \fIplugin\fR. The name is
automatically prefixed with \f(CW\*(C`Code::TidyAll::Plugin::\*(C'\fR unless it begins with a
\&'+', e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    ; Uses plugin Code::TidyAll::Plugin::PerlTidy
\&    ;
\&    [PerlTidy]
\&
\&    ; Uses plugin My::TidyAll::Plugin
\&    ;
\&    [+My::TidyAll::Plugin]
.Ve
.Sp
You can also include an optional description after the class. The description
will be ignored and only the first word will be used for the plugin. This
allows you to a list a plugin more than once, with different configuration each
time.  For example, two different \f(CW\*(C`PerlCritic\*(C'\fR configurations:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    ; Be brutal on libraries
\&    ;
\&    [PerlCritic strict]
\&    select = lib/**/*.pm
\&    argv = \-\-brutal
\&
\&    ; but gentle on scripts
\&    ;
\&    [PerlCritic lenient]
\&    select = bin/**/*.pl
\&    argv = \-\-gentle
.Ve
.Sp
Warning: If you simply list the same plugin twice with no description (or the
same description), one of them will be silently ignored.
.IP "select" 4
.IX Item "select"
One or more File::Zglob patterns, separated by whitespace or on multiple
lines, indicating which files to select. At least one is required. e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    ; All .t and .pl somewhere under bin and t;
\&    ; plus all .pm files directly under lib/Foo and lib/Bar
\&    ;
\&    select = {bin,t}/**/*.p[lm]
\&    select = lib/{Foo,Bar}/*.pm
\&
\&    ; All .txt files anywhere in the project
\&    ;
\&    select = **/*.txt
.Ve
.Sp
The pattern is relative to the root directory and should have no leading slash.
All standard glob characters (\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`[]\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`{}\*(C'\fR) will work; in addition,
\&\f(CW\*(C`**\*(C'\fR can be used to represent zero or more directories. See File::Zglob
documentation for more details.
.IP "ignore" 4
.IX Item "ignore"
One or more File::Zglob patterns, separated by whitespace or on multiple
lines, indicating which files to ignore.  This is optional and overrides
\&\f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR. e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    ; All .pl files anywhere under bin, except bin/awful.pl or anywhere
\&    ; under bin/tmp
\&    ;
\&    select = bin/**/*.pl
\&    ignore = bin/awful.pl bin/tmp/**/*.pl
.Ve
.Sp
Ignore patterns can also specified at the beginning of the file before any
plugin section was started, thus making them global. These ignores will be
applied for all plugins.
.IP "shebang" 4
.IX Item "shebang"
One or more words on multiple lines, indicating which shebang lines to accept.
This is optional and further filters \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR.  e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&    ; All files with no extension anywhere under bin that include a "perl" or
\&    ; "perl5" shebang line.
\&    select = bin/**/*
\&    ignore = bin/**/*.*
\&    shebang = perl
\&    shebang = perl5
.Ve
.IP "only_modes" 4
.IX Item "only_modes"
A list of modes, separated by whitespace. e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    only_modes = test cli
.Ve
.Sp
The plugin will \fIonly\fR run if one of these modes is passed to \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR via
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-mode\*(C'\fR.
.IP "except_modes" 4
.IX Item "except_modes"
A list of modes, separated by whitespace. e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    except_modes = commit editor
.Ve
.Sp
The plugin will \fInot\fR run if one of these modes is passed to \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR via
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-mode\*(C'\fR.
.IP "argv" 4
.IX Item "argv"
Many plugins (such as perltidy,
perlcritic and
podtidy) take this option, which specifies
arguments to pass to the underlying command-line utility.
.IP "weight" 4
.IX Item "weight"
This is an integer that is used to sort plugins. By default, tidier plugins run
first, then validator plugins, with each group sorted alphabetically.
.SH "PLUGIN ORDER AND ATOMICITY"
.IX Header "PLUGIN ORDER AND ATOMICITY"
If multiple plugins match a file, tidiers are applied before validators so that
validators are checking the final result. Within those two groups, the plugins
are applied in alphabetical order by plugin name/description.
.PP
You can also explicitly set the weight of each plugin. By default, tidiers have
a weight of 50 and validators have a weight of 60. You can set the weight to
any integer to influence when the plugin runs.
.PP
The application of multiple plugins is all-or-nothing. If an error occurs
during the application of any plugin, the file is not modified at all.
.SH "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
.IX Header "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS"
.IP "\-a, \-\-all" 4
.IX Item "-a, --all"
Process all files. Does a recursive search for all files in the project
hierarchy, starting at the root, and processes any file that matches at least
one plugin in the configuration.
.IP "\-i, \-\-ignore" 4
.IX Item "-i, --ignore"
Ignore matching files. This uses zglob syntax. You can pass this option more
than once.
.IP "\-g, \-\-git" 4
.IX Item "-g, --git"
Process all added or modified files in the current git working directory.
.IP "\-l, \-\-list" 4
.IX Item "-l, --list"
List each file along with the list of plugins it matches (files without any
matches are skipped). Does not actually process any files and does not care
whether files are cached. Generally used with \-a, \-g, or \-s. e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    % tidyall \-a \-l
\&    lib/CHI.pm (PerlCritic, PerlTidy, PodTidy)
\&    lib/CHI/Benchmarks.pod (PodTidy)
\&    lib/CHI/CacheObject.pm (PerlCritic, PerlTidy, PodTidy)
.Ve
.IP "\-m, \-\-mode" 4
.IX Item "-m, --mode"
Optional mode that can affect which plugins run. Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`cli\*(C'\fR. See
\&\*(L"\s-1MODES\*(R"\s0.
.IP "\-p path, \-\-pipe path" 4
.IX Item "-p path, --pipe path"
Read content from \s-1STDIN\s0 and write the resulting content to \s-1STDOUT.\s0  If
successful, tidyall exits with status 0. If an error occurs, tidyall outputs
the error message to \s-1STDERR,\s0 \fImirrors the input content\fR to \s-1STDOUT\s0 with no
changes, and exits with status 1. The mirroring means that you can safely pipe
to your destination regardless of whether an error occurs.
.Sp
When specifying this option you must specify exactly one filename, relative or
absolute, which will be used to determine which plugins to apply and also where
the root directory and configuration file are. The file will not actually be
read and does need even need to exist.
.Sp
This option implies \-\-no\-backups and \-\-no\-cache (since there's no actual file)
and \-\-quiet (since we don't want to mix extraneous output with the tidied
result).
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    # Read from STDIN and write to STDOUT, with appropriate plugins
\&    # for some/path.pl (which need not exist)
\&    #
\&    % tidyall \-\-pipe some/path.pl
.Ve
.IP "\-r, \-\-recursive" 4
.IX Item "-r, --recursive"
Recursively enter any directories listed on the command-line and process all
the files within. By default, directories encountered on the command-line will
generate a warning.
.IP "\-j, \-\-jobs" 4
.IX Item "-j, --jobs"
Specify how many jobs should run in parallel. By default, we only run 1, but if
you have multiple cores this should cause tidyall to run faster, especially on
larger code bases.
.IP "\-s, \-\-svn" 4
.IX Item "-s, --svn"
Process all added or modified files in the current svn working directory.
.IP "\-q, \-\-quiet" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Suppress output except for errors.
.IP "\-v, \-\-verbose" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Show extra output.
.IP "\-I \fIpath1,path2,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I path1,path2,..."
Add one or more library paths to \f(CW@INC\fR, like Perl's \-I. Useful if
\&\-\-tidyall\-class or plugins are in an alternate lib directory.
.IP "\-\-backup\-ttl \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "--backup-ttl duration"
Amount of time before backup files can be purged. Can be a number of seconds or
any string recognized by Time::Duration::Parse, e.g. \*(L"4h\*(R" or \*(L"1day\*(R".
Defaults to \*(L"1h\*(R".
.IP "\-\-check\-only" 4
.IX Item "--check-only"
Instead of actually tidying files, check if each file is tidied (i.e. if its
tidied version is equal to its current version) and consider it an error if
not. This is used by Test::Code::TidyAll and the
svn and git
pre-commit hooks, for example, to enforce that you've tidied your files.
.IP "\-\-plugins \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--plugins name"
Only run the specified plugins. The name should match the name given in the
config file exactly, including a leading \*(L"+\*(R" if one exists.
.Sp
This overrides the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-mode\*(C'\fR option.
.Sp
Note that plugins will still only run on files which match their \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`ignore\*(C'\fR configuration.
.IP "\-\-conf\-file \fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--conf-file path"
Specify relative or absolute path to conf file, instead of searching for it in
the usual way.
.IP "\-\-conf\-name \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--conf-name name"
Specify a conf file name to search for instead of the defaults (\f(CW\*(C`tidyall.ini\*(C'\fR
/ \f(CW\*(C`.tidyallrc\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\-\-data\-dir \fIpath\fR" 4
.IX Item "--data-dir path"
Contains data like backups and cache. Defaults to root_dir/.tidyall.d
.IP "\-\-iterations \fIcount\fR" 4
.IX Item "--iterations count"
Run each tidier transform \fIcount\fR times. Default is 1.
.Sp
In some cases (hopefully rare) the output from a tidier can be different if it
is applied multiple times. You may want to perform multiple iterations to make
sure the content \*(L"settles\*(R" into its final tidied form \*(-- especially if the
tidiness is being enforced with a version-control hook or a test. Of course,
performance will suffer a little. You should rarely need to set this higher
than 2.
.Sp
This only affects tidiers, not validators; e.g.
perlcritic and
jshint would still only be run once.
.IP "\-\-no\-backups" 4
.IX Item "--no-backups"
Don't backup files before processing.
.IP "\-\-no\-cache" 4
.IX Item "--no-cache"
Don't cache last processed times; process all files every time. See also
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-refresh\-cache\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-\-no\-cleanup" 4
.IX Item "--no-cleanup"
Don't clean up temporary files.
.IP "\-\-output\-suffix \fIsuffix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-suffix suffix"
Suffix to add to a filename before outputting the modified version, e.g.
\&\f(CW\*(C`.tdy\*(C'\fR. Default is none, which means overwrite the file.
.IP "\-\-refresh\-cache" 4
.IX Item "--refresh-cache"
Erase any existing cache info before processing each file, then write new cache
info. See also \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-cache\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-\-root\-dir" 4
.IX Item "--root-dir"
Specify root directory explicitly. Usually this is inferred from the specified
files or the current working directory.
.IP "\-\-tidyall\-class \fIclass\fR" 4
.IX Item "--tidyall-class class"
Subclass to use instead of \f(CW\*(C`Code::TidyAll\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Show the version of Code::TidyAll that this script invokes.
.IP "\-h, \-\-help" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Print help message
.SS "Specifying options in configuration"
.IX Subsection "Specifying options in configuration"
Almost any command-line option can be specified at the top of the config file,
above the plugin sections. Replace dashes with underscores. e.g.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    backup_ttl = 4h
\&    iterations = 2
\&    tidyall_class = My::Code::TidyAll
\&
\&    [PerlTidy]
\&    select = **/*.{pl,pm,t}
\&    argv = \-noll \-it=2
\&
\&    ...
.Ve
.PP
If an option is passed in both places, the command-line takes precedence.
.PP
\fIinc\fR
.IX Subsection "inc"
.PP
You can specify \f(CW\*(C`inc\*(C'\fR as a global configuration option outside of any plugin's
section. You can specify this more than once to include multiple directories.
Any directories you list here will be \fIprepended\fR to \f(CW@INC\fR before loading
plugins or a \f(CW\*(C`tidyall_class\*(C'\fR
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will exit with status 1 if any errors occurred while processing
files, and 0 otherwise.
.SH "MODES"
.IX Header "MODES"
You can use tidyall in a number of different contexts, and you may not want to
run all plugins in all of them.
.PP
You can pass a mode to tidyall via \f(CW\*(C`\-m\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-\-mode\*(C'\fR, and then specify that
certain plugins should only be run in certain modes (via \*(L"only_modes\*(R") or
should be run in all but certain modes (via \*(L"except_modes\*(R").
.PP
Examples of modes:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`cli\*(C'\fR \- when invoking tidyall explicitly from the command-line with no mode
specified
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`editor\*(C'\fR \- when invoking from an editor
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`commit\*(C'\fR \- when using a commit hook like Code::TidyAll::SVN::Precommit or
Code::TidyAll::Git::Precommit
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`test\*(C'\fR \- when using Test::Code::TidyAll
.PP
Now since perlcritic is a bit
time-consuming, you might only want to run it during tests and explicit
command-line invocation:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    [PerlCritic]
\&    select = lib/**/*.pm
\&    only_modes = test cli
\&    ...
.Ve
.PP
Or you could specify that it be run in all modes \fIexcept\fR the editor:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    [PerlCritic]
\&    select = lib/**/*.pm
\&    except_modes = editor
\&    ...
.Ve
.PP
If you specify neither \f(CW\*(C`only_modes\*(C'\fR nor \f(CW\*(C`except_modes\*(C'\fR for a plugin, then it
will always run.
.SH "LAST-PROCESSED CACHE"
.IX Header "LAST-PROCESSED CACHE"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR keeps track of each file's signature after it was last processed. On
subsequent runs, it will only process a file if its signature has changed. The
cache is kept in files under the data dir.
.PP
You can force a refresh of the cache with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-refresh\-cache\*(C'\fR, or turn off the
behavior entirely with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-cache\*(C'\fR.
.SH "BACKUPS"
.IX Header "BACKUPS"
\&\f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR will backup each file before modifying it. The timestamped backups
are kept in a separate directory hierarchy under the data dir.

Old backup files will be purged automatically as part of occasional \f(CW\*(C`tidyall\*(C'\fR
runs. The duration specified in \f(CW\*(C`\-\-backup\-ttl\*(C'\fR indicates both the minimum
amount of time backups should be kept, and the frequency that purges should be
run. It may be specified as \*(L"30m\*(R" or \*(L"4 hours\*(R" or any string acceptable to
Time::Duration::Parse. It defaults to \*(L"1h\*(R" (1 hour).

You can turn off backups with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-backups\*(C'\fR.

perltidy, you must install the Perl::Tidy
module manually.
