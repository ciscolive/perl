.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIcronjob\fR is a fairly simple Perl program that's meant to be used to wrap
anything you want run from a \fIcrontab\fR.  It was originally written to cope
with the highly deficient Solaris \fIcrond\fR, but now provides features that are
useful even under relatively sane and otherwise tolerable cron daemons.
.PP
The most important argument to \fIcronjob\fR is \f(CW\*(C`\-\-command\*(C'\fR (aka \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR).  It
gives the command to be run.  If you want to run \fIsome-maintenance-job\fR every
day at noon, you might put this in your \fIcrontab\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  0 12 * * *           cronjob \-c \*(Aqsome\-maintenance\-job \-\-xyzzy\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Here's what will happen when that job is run:
.PP
Unless you provided \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-lock\*(C'\fR, an exclusive lock will be created on a
temporary file in \fI/tmp\fR.  The locking process is described more
below.  Basically, it tries to prevent more than one of the same,
or closely-related, jobs from running concurrently.
.PP
The job will be run with no input.  Its combined \s-1STDOUT\s0 and \s-1STDERR\s0 are
captured, along with its exit (wait) status.
.PP
When the command has terminated, a report is sent if:
.IP "\(bu" 4
the command couldn't lock (unless \f(CW\*(C`\-\-ignore\-errors lock\*(C'\fR or, if \f(CW\*(C`\-\-temp\-ignore\-lock\-errors=\*(C'\fR\fIsecs\fR was given, the lock was created no more than \fIsecs\fR seconds ago.
.IP "\(bu" 4
the command had any output (unless \f(CW\*(C`\-\-errors\-only\*(C'\fR)
.IP "\(bu" 4
the command exited non-zero (always)
.PP
The report will include a summary of the process and its behavior, including
the time taken to run, the exit status, any signal received, and whether core
was dumped.  It will also include the full (combined) output of the process.
.PP
The report will be send from \f(CW\*(C`\-\-sender\*(C'\fR (or a reasonable default) to \f(CW\*(C`\-\-rcpt\*(C'\fR
(or \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR).  Its \f(CW\*(C`In\-Reply\-To\*(C'\fR header will be set to a hashed value that
will cause all same-subject jobs to thread together in threaded mail readers.
The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-subject\*(C'\fR switch sets the message subject, so it's responsible for
deciding which jobs thread together.  For jobs that run with variable
arguments, providing a \f(CW\*(C`\-\-subject\*(C'\fR argument is a very good idea.
.SS "locking"
.IX Subsection "locking"
The default lockfile name is generated with code something like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $lockname = $opt\->jobname || ( md5_sum( $opt\->subject || $opt\->command ) );
\&  my $lockfile = sprintf \*(Aq/tmp/cronjob.%s\*(Aq, $lockname;
.Ve
.PP
In other words, if you specify a \f(CW\*(C`\-\-jobname\*(C'\fR option, that will be used for
naming the lockfile.  This lets you force otherwise unrelated cronjobs to block
each other.  If you don't provide a job name, one is created by hashing the
subject (of the report to send) or, failing that, the command itself.  The
hashing is a simple measure to prevent long or metacharacter-ridden filenames.
.PP
The lockfile will contain information about the process that has the lock,
including when it was begun.
.PP
By default, all jobs are locked and failure to acquire a lock causes immediate
failure of the cronjob.  A failure report will be sent.  To suppress failure
reports in the event of lock failure, pass \f(CW\*(C`\-\-ignore\-errors lock\*(C'\fR to the
command.  To skip locking, pass \f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-lock\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Note that ignoring \f(CW\*(C`lock\*(C'\fR failures only ignores failure to \f(CW\*(C`flock\*(C'\fR the
lockfile.  If the file can't even be created, an error will still be reported.
It will be of type \f(CW\*(C`lockfile\*(C'\fR, and can be ignored by adding another
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-ignore\-errors\*(C'\fR option for that type.
