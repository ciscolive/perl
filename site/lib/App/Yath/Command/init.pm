=head1 NAME

App::Yath::Command::init - Create/update test.pl to run tests via Test2::Harness

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command will create or update the 'test.pl' file in the current directory.
This 'test.pl' file this creates will run all your tests via yath.

This command will fail if there is already a test.pl file that does not look
like it was generated by this command.


=head1 USAGE

    $ yath [YATH OPTIONS] init [COMMAND OPTIONS]

=head2 YATH OPTIONS

=head3 Developer

=over 4

=item --dev-lib

=item --dev-lib=lib

=item -D

=item -D=lib

=item -Dlib

=item --no-dev-lib

Add paths to @INC before loading ANYTHING. This is what you use if you are developing yath or yath plugins to make sure the yath script finds the local code instead of the installed versions of the same code. You can provide an argument (-Dfoo) to provide a custom path, or you can just use -D without and arg to add lib, blib/lib and blib/arch.

Can be specified multiple times

=item --persist-file ARG

=item --pfile ARG

=item --pfile=ARG

=item --no-persist-file

Where to find the persistence file. The default is /{system-tempdir}/project-yath-persist.json. If no project is specified then it will fall back to the current directory. If the current directory is not writable it will default to /tmp/yath-persist.json which limits you to one persistent runner on your system.


=item --project ARG

This lets you provide a label for your current project/codebase. This is best used in a .yath.rc file. This is necessary for a persistent runner.
