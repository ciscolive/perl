=head1 NAME

Promise::XS - Fast promises in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Promise::XS ();

    my $deferred = Promise::XS::deferred();

    # Do one of these once you have the result of your operation:
    $deferred->resolve( 'foo', 'bar' );
    $deferred->reject( 'oh', 'no!' );

    # Give this to your caller:
    my $promise = $deferred->promise();

The following aggregator functions are exposed:

    # Resolves with a list of arrayrefs, one per promise.
    # Rejects with the results from the first rejected promise.
    my $all_p = Promise::XS::all( $promise1, $promise2, .. );

    # Resolves/rejects with the results from the first
    # resolved or rejected promise.
    my $race_p = Promise::XS::race( $promise3, $promise4, .. );

For compatibility with preexisting libraries, C<all()> may also be called
as C<collect()>.

The following also exist:

    my $pre_resolved_promise = Promise::XS::resolved('already', 'done');

    my $pre_rejected_promise = Promise::XS::rejected('it’s', 'bad');

All of C<Promise::XS>’s static functions may be exported at load time,
e.g., C<use Promise::XS qw(deferred)>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exposes a Promise interface with its major parts
implemented in XS for speed. It is a fork and refactor of
L<AnyEvent::XSPromises>. That module’s interface, a “bare-bones”
subset of that from L<Promises>, is retained.

=head1 STATUS

This module is stable, well-tested, and suitable for production use.

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM ECMASCRIPT PROMISES

This library is built for compatibility with pre-existing Perl promise
libraries. It thus exhibits some salient differences from how
ECMAScript promises work:

=over

=item * Neither the C<resolve()> method of deferred objects
nor the C<resolved()> convenience function define behavior when given
a promise object.

=item * The C<all()> and C<race()> functions accept a list of promises,
not a “scalar-array-thing” (ECMAScript “arrays” being what in Perl we
call “array references”). So whereas in ECMAScript you do:

    Promise.all( [ promise1, promise2 ] );

… in this library it’s:

    Promise::XS::all( $promise1, $promise2 );

=item * Promise resolutions and rejections may contain multiple values.
(But see L</AVOID MULTIPLES> below.)

=back

See L<Promise::ES6> for an interface that imitates ECMAScript promises
more closely.

=head1 AVOID MULTIPLES

For compatibility with preexisting Perl promise libraries, Promise::XS
allows a promise to resolve or reject with multiple values. This behavior,
while eminently “perlish”, allows for some weird cases where the relevant
standards don’t apply: for example, what happens if multiple promises are
returned from a promise callback? Or even just a single promise plus extra
returns?

Promise::XS tries to help you catch such cases by throwing a warning
if multiple return values from a callback contain a promise as the
first member. For best results, though—and consistency with promise
implementations outside Perl—resolve/reject all promises with I<single>
values.

=head1 DIFFERENCES FROM L<Promises> ET AL.

=head2 Empty or uninitialized rejection values

Promise rejections fulfill the same role in asynchronous code that exceptions
do in synchronous code. Perl helpfully warns (under the C<warnings> pragma,
anyhow) when you C<die(undef)> since an uninitialized value isn’t useful as
an error report and likely indicates a problem.

Promise::XS mimics this behavior by warning if a rejection value list lacks
a defined value. This can happen if the value list is either empty or
contains exclusively uninitialized values.

=head2 C<finally()>

This module implements ECMAScript’s C<finally()> interface, which differs
from that in some other Perl promise implementations.

Given the following …

    my $new = $p->finally( $callback );

=over

=item * C<$callback> receives I<no> arguments.

=item * If C<$callback> returns anything but a single, rejected promise,
C<$new> has the same status as C<$p>.

=item * If C<$callback> throws, or if it returns a single, rejected promise,
C<$new> is rejected with the relevant value(s).

=back

=head1 EVENT LOOPS

By default this library uses no event loop. This is a generally usable
configuration; however, it’ll be a bit different from how promises usually
work in evented contexts (e.g., JavaScript) because callbacks will execute
immediately rather than at the end of the event loop as the Promises/A+
specification requires. Following this pattern facilitates use of recursive
promises without exceeding call stack limits.

To achieve full Promises/A+ compliance it’s necessary to integrate with
an event loop interface. This library supports three such interfaces:

=over

=item * L<AnyEvent>:

    Promise::XS::use_event('AnyEvent');

=item * L<IO::Async> - note the need for an L<IO::Async::Loop> instance
as argument:

    Promise::XS::use_event('IO::Async', $loop_object);

=item * L<Mojo::IOLoop>:

    Promise::XS::use_event('Mojo::IOLoop');

=back

Note that all three of the above are event loop B<interfaces>. They
aren’t event loops themselves, but abstractions over various event loops.
See each one’s documentation for details about supported event loops.

=head1 MEMORY LEAK DETECTION

Any promise created while C<$Promise::XS::DETECT_MEMORY_LEAKS> is truthy
will throw a warning if it survives until global destruction.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

You can re-bless a L<Promise::XS::Promise> instance into a different class,
and C<then()>, C<catch()>, and C<finally()> will assign their newly-created
promise into that other class. (It follows that the other class must subclass
L<Promise::XS::Promise>.) This can be useful, e.g., for implementing
mid-flight controls like cancellation.

=head1 TODO

=over

=item * C<all()> and C<race()> should ideally be implemented in XS.

=back

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

=over

=item * Interpreter-based threads may or may not work.

=item * This module interacts badly with Perl’s fork() implementation on
Windows. There may be a workaround possible, but none is implemented for now.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Besides L<AnyEvent::XSPromises> and L<Promises>, you may like L<Promise::ES6>,
which mimics L<ECMAScript’s “Promise” class|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise> as much as possible.
It can even
(experimentally) use this module as a backend, which helps but is still
significantly slower than using this module directly.
