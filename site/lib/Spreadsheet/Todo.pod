=head1 TO DO

Steps to implement with/for L<Spreadsheet::Read>

=over 4

=item 1

Do not strip whitespace of cell contents,

It currently gets me ', but xlsx returns an empty field. It is up to you to decide what you want

And a field with just a single ' should return an empty field, but I would accept a single quote too

a field can hold a single space as valid content. I don't think you should strip trailing spaces by default

=item 2

Support for cell attributes: background color, text color,

=item 3

the rest

=back

=cut
