=head1 NAME

patchperl - patch a perl source tree

=head1 VERSION

version 2.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  patchperl

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over

=item C<--version>

Prints the version of L<Devel::PatchPerl> to STDOUT and exits

=item C<--patchlevel>

Devel::PatchPerl will normally update the C<patchlevel.h> file in the perl source tree
to indicate that it has applied local patches. This behaviour is negated if it is
detected that it is operating in a git repository. To override this and update
C<patchlevel.h> when in a Git repository use this switch.
