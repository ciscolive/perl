=head1 NAME

ebug_client - Debugger client for remote debugging Perl script

=head1 VERSION

version 0.63

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ebug-client -key <secret> -port <port>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ebug-client is an debugger front end for attaching to
remotely executing perl script, running on ebug-server.

To invoke ebug-client, you must first invoke ebug-server to
run debuggee and generate "key" and "port" needed for connection.
When ebug-server is invoked, it will show exact command-line to
invoke ebug-client.

=head1 EXAMPLE

 # Attach to ebug-server running on port 4023, with key "begripra"
 $ ebug-client -key begripra -port 4023

=head1 NOTE

Currently, you cannot "restart" debuggee. You'll need to
restart one manually by re-invoking both ebug-server and
ebug-client.

Since Devel::ebug::Backend listens to "localhost" socket,
you will need to relay I/O using tool like socat for true
remote debugging.

Internally, thanks for it being free software, it is almost
a complete ripoff of Devel::ebug source.
